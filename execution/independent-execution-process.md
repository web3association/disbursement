# Independent execution process

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/independent-execution-process.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

An independent execution process means that the suggestion and selection of the most suitable contributors to help contribute towards executing ideas in an ecosystem is done separately from how priorities or ideas get suggested or selected.

The main connection that execution has with the disbursement process is through the execution of ideas. Contributors working within an ecosystem are able to contribute towards addressing ecosystem priorities by executing the most promising ideas.

When thinking about the connection between ideas and execution there are a number of complicated factors that will require further experimentation to better determine when it makes sense to adopt any of the different independent execution process approaches. Some main areas of concern will be around team synergies, productive working structures and idea ownership.

There are a range of potential advantages for adopting an independent execution process due to how it can help with increasing flexibility and collaboration for contributors and also help create much simpler, scalable and more flexible decision making process for voters.



**Advantages of an independent execution process**

* **Lower voter participation complexity** - A voter could just participate in the contributor selection process and does not need to help with the selection of the most promising ideas. Similarly voters could also just participate in idea selection if they didn’t want to participate in contributor selection. By keeping this process independent a wider range of community members may choose to participate in either the idea or contributor selection processes based on which they are interested in and have the capacity for.
* **More voter choice flexibility** - Separating idea and contributor selection means that voters can decide on exactly which ideas and contributors they believe are the most promising and important. The voter is able to express their opinion and preferences exactly for which ideas are most promising and which contributors could be the most effective. When ideas and contributors are combined the voter only have the choice to react to what combinations are submitted by the contributors who suggest the ideas.
* **Lower voter decision complexity** - Voters don’t need to compare the merits of an idea alongside the competencies of the contributors attached to those ideas if these processes were independent. Instead the voter would just be comparing the merits of different ideas and fully focussing on that decision before then comparing the different contributors looking to work on those ideas. This helps make it easier for the best ideas to get selected without concern about the contributors working on that idea at that stage in the process.
* **Lower future change complexity** - If voters wanted to update or change which ideas they believe are the most promising or vote on which contributors are the most suitable they could reuse the same independent processes to do so. If these processes were combined then there would be a full duplication of the information being added that covers both the idea and contributors they are looking to vote on. New ideas would need to be put forward along with the contributors who are going to execute those ideas which could end up slowing down future changes by increasing the complexity to submit a new or updated idea.
* **Lower contributor participation complexity** - Contributors would be able to contribute to just the idea generation part of the process if they preferred to do so or alternatively contributors could also just suggest themselves as suitable candidates to help with the execution of any ideas. By keeping the ideas and execution processes separate contributors are able to more easily participate in the ecosystem exactly the way they want to.
* **Encourages more collaboration & discussion** - Keeping the idea generation and selection process separated from selecting contributors to work on those ideas helps to create a better environment for encouraging collaboration and discussion. Idea generation and selection could happen on an ongoing basis if funds aren’t being disbursed at the point of selecting the most promising ideas. Removing the pressure from contributors needing to suggest the most promising ideas to get funding can help with incentivising contributors to instead look for how they can collaborate on existing popular ideas to demonstrate how they could provide impact in the ecosystem and increase their chance of being selected by the community at the voting stage. Allowing a sufficient amount of time for voters and contributors to consider and compare the ideas being suggested can help with improving the chances that contributors collaborate through identifying shared problems and interests between similar ideas.
* **Increased flexibility** - When ideas and contributors are combined and funding is allocated at the point of idea selection the incentive for the contributor is to execute the idea they were funded for. Putting emphasis on the importance of voters selecting both ideas and contributors are the same time could be problematic if the idea needs to change or a more impactful idea suddenly emerges. If ideas are not connected to contributors in the disbursement process then contributors could instead be able to reallocate their time towards new emerging ideas that are more promising and potentially impactful. Giving flexibility to voters to vote and discuss new ideas can then make it easier for contributors to dynamically adjust how they’re approaching any existing ideas or reallocate time to address new ideas that tackle any emerging problems or opportunities.



**Drawbacks of an independent execution process**

* **Execution risks around idea ownership** - If contributors are not connected to ideas in the same selection process then there is a risk of having changing or conflicting leadership during the execution of those ideas. Complex ideas can require strong leadership from people who have the right experience, competencies and willingness to take an idea all the way through to execution. The more complex an idea is the more important it will be to have the right leadership in place so that an idea is executed effectively. An independent process could potentially address this problem by considering additional processes that help with the selection of leaders for certain ideas where they would have partial or full control over the contributors who should be involved and/or the approach being taken for execution. This area of concern will require more analysis and experimentation to identify when this is an issue and the different ways it could be resolved.
* **Team synergy risks** - If contributors are able to move more freely between ideas to execute the most promising ones to provide the most value for an ecosystem there is an increased risk that the team dynamics could not be as productive or effective. Building teams that have sufficient amounts of rapport with each other can take time. An independent idea selection process will need to factor in how teams are formed for the different ideas and whether team building should be pre-determined, be organised in a separate process after idea selection or if it can be work when being determined by the voters.
* **Productive operational risks** - If it becomes easier for voters to change their decisions on which ideas are the most promising or which contributors are most suitable there is a risk of reducing the continuity of the people involved that contribute towards the ecosystem. This increases the risk of having less efficient execution efforts if teams are changing too often. An independent process for contributor selection would need to factor in what continuity makes sense to minimise disruption. This could mean considering the implications between selecting contributors for certain term times like 6, 12 or 24 months.
