**Overview**

Individual time based contribution logs mean that each individual would submit evidence of their contribution efforts after each set time period. A time period of once per month could be a suitable starting point for most ecosystems.



**High contribution measurability (Score - 4)**

Contribution logs would be recorded after a certain time period such as each month and also would always be scoped to a single individual. This makes it easy to measure and compare how much contribution output one contributor has made against others.



**Very high contribution log accuracy (Score - 5)**

This approach gives the highest accuracy on exactly who has contributed what in an ecosystem which improves the discovery for the community to find people who have worked on certain areas. This can be useful for asking questions, getting feedback, or helping with future collaborations where other contributors would benefit from knowing who exactly did what so they can reach out to the right people.



**Low game theory risks (Score - 4)**

Every contributor submitting monthly contribution logs would mean it would become far easier to spot contributors who are trying to game the system and do less work but receive the same compensation. This reduction in risk is achieved by using a constant time period such as monthly periods and then also by keeping the contribution scope focussed on individuals. This makes it hard to hide from truth of what a contributor has actually done in a months worth of contribution.



**High verification time required (Score - 1.6)**

Individual time based contribution logs would mean capturing the highest depth of information compared to the other approaches. This would result in it taking longer than the other approaches for moderators to verify this information. The average time required to verify submissions for any verification approach should reduce over time as the tools and processes improve.



**High submission time required (Score - 1.2)**

Each contributor would need to keep a note of what they have done each month and provide that as evidence in their contribution log. This is something that should become easier over time as more processes and tools become available to automate this information gathering.



**Total score = 15.4 / 21**
