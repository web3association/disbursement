The [general purpose operating process](https://app.gitbook.com/s/qIN4B3DGHPqKOl7e6VuV/web3-treasuries/operating-process) can be applied more directly to the treasury disbursement process. Applying this process can help with thinking about how each of the processes involved in disbursement could be improved over time and how disbursement and each of its processes can play an important role in helping an ecosystem achieve its priorities and generate impact for the ecosystem.

Each of the disbursement processes are covered in more detail in the following documentation:

## **Disbursement process comparisons**

Each of the disbursement processes can be compared with each other to better understand the amount of information that is involved, theirs rate of change, how important each one is for disbursement, how responsibilities could be delegated in each of the processes and the overall complexity of each process:&#x20;
