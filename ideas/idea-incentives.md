## Applicable disbursement approaches

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/idea-incentive-applicable-approaches.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Any approach that adopts an independently operated idea process will need to think about how that process is incentivised. The applicable disbursement approaches include:

* Independent processes
* Passive idea selection process
* Delegated idea selection process

The fully combined process and idea & contributor combined process is not applicable for this analysis as the incentives for ideas would be handled inside proposals that include the execution part of the process.



## Idea submission process

Incentives could be used to help encourage people to submit ideas that if executed could help with addressing any existing priorities in the ecosystem. An incentive for idea proposals will need to consider how it encourages people to add all of the relevant information for voters to be well informed on whether an idea is a promising potential solution or not. Incentives could be used to reward voters for reading and voting on the selection of the most promising ideas. Incentive could potentially also be used for encouraging proposers to add any supporting information that helps to further justify the potential impact of an idea.



**Desirable outcomes**

* **Quality submissions** - Ideas can be complex and require a lot of information to effectively articulate how the idea would be executed and what benefits it would bring against other approaches. The process for the submission of ideas will benefit from the incentives being aligned with proposers providing a sufficient amount of depth of information to justify why their ideas are well thought out and promising solutions.
* **Feasible** - Some ideas can sound fantastic on paper but could be overly complex, impractical or even impossible to execute. Incentives will need to consider how proposers are encouraged to submit ideas that are practical and achievable over ideas that over promise and are not realistic. One potential solution area for handling problems around feasibility could be the inclusion of a reputation based approach with the idea submission process so voters are aware of the previous track record of proposers and how often the ideas they suggest have been feasibly executed and resulted in high impact outcomes.
* **Inclusive** - There are often many different ideas that could help with addressing the existing priorities in an ecosystem. Those ideas can have different trade offs and implications. Ecosystems can benefit from inviting the submission of a diversity of different ideas for the ecosystem to consider and iterate on. Incentives will need to consider the trade offs of being inclusive and inviting wider participation whilst also making a practical process that doesn’t become overwhelmed with too many ideas.
* **Collaborative** - Too many ideas that lack sufficient justification could result in the need for a moderation process so that proposals meet a quality threshold. Additionally or alternatively a multi step process for idea submission could help with handling ideas that are a draft state before a final version is submitted. Incentives could be used to help with increasing the amount of collaboration between contributors in thinking about and iterating on different ideas and merging ideas together when there is a high amount of overlap.
* **Timely submissions** - New ideas could emerge at any point and could offer a promising way to generate impact for the ecosystem. Due to this an idea process can benefit from encouraging people to submit ideas at any stage and start any collaboration and discussion around those ideas. Incentives could be used to encourage this behaviour however as the execution of ideas is often incentivised through compensation there a natural incentive for people to submit ideas whenever they are ready.
* **Aligned with addressing priorities** - Priorities can be addressed through the execution of promising ideas. The systems and processes used for idea submission and selection can help with increasing the incentive for people to submit and execute promising ideas that address important priorities. This process should be careful not to exclude efforts that don’t align with the existing priorities as these efforts could also be impactful and highly innovative.



**Concerns**

* **Availability of contributors to execute** - Selecting promising ideas to execute is only truly useful when there are suitable contributors available to help with the execution of those ideas. If the selection of ideas and contributors are handled separately the systems and processes used for idea and contributor selection will need to consider what amount of ideas should be practically encouraged based on the budget and contributors readily available to execute those suggested ideas.
* **Leadership** - Many ideas that are more complex or larger in scope might need the right leadership in place to ensure the execution of an idea is handled as intended and that problems are mitigated and resolved more effectively as they emerge. The approach for incentives that get adopted could likely play an important role in the quality of leadership an ecosystem is able to attract and retain.
* **Information complexity** - Ideas can require a lot of different pieces of information to explain and justify why the solution is suitable. There is a risk that an idea submission process becomes overwhelmed with too many ideas and information if it does not effectively incentivise and encourage the submission of high quality submissions instead of a growing number of average submissions as an ecosystem and its disbursement process tries to scale.



**Potential proposal submission incentive approaches**

* **No incentive** - Incentives do not need to be attached to the submission process for ideas when there is already an incentive for compensating the contributors that will help with executing those ideas. The contributors who are selected to help with the execution of ideas would already have an incentive to generate impact by submitting promising ideas that they could work on. Creating a good idea helps to demonstrate to voters that contributors are well informed about a given topic area and could be more suitable for being selected to be a contributor in the ecosystem. The issue with no incentive is it could result in a smaller amount of participation from the wider community as they wouldn’t be compensated for suggesting ideas unless they were committed to becoming a contributor. Community members would have no incentive to help with the idea submission process beyond the non financial incentives that exist such as wanting to suggest and see positive change in the ecosystem.
* **Selection incentive** - The selection of ideas could result in compensation for the authors that submitted that idea. This incentive could result in separating the responsibility of executing and idea with submitting an idea if independent processes were used. Under this approach there could be a higher risk that an idea does not have the contributors required to execute an idea as intended if this has not been verified before hand. A benefit to providing some form of compensation for ideas at the point of selection is it could help to encourage a wider diversity of idea submissions from the wider community and not just by those who are executing the ideas. If the contributors executing the ideas are already submitting high quality ideas this added incentive at the point of idea selection might not be necessary.



## Idea **information maintenance**

Selected ideas that get executed over time will create new information about the progress and importance of an existing idea. This information should become available to the voters for improving any future decision making. Further evidence from different knowledge sources could also become available over time which provide more supporting reasons about why one certain solution approach is more suitable than another. Proposers may also want to add new information to justify why an existing idea needed to be changed and improved so it can create more impact for the ecosystem. Considerations should be made towards how incentives can help to keep idea related information up to date. The incentives could be handled at the point of execution where contributors who are selected to work on an idea could also be responsible for keeping idea information up to date. Alternatively incentives could be used to encourage anyone in a community to maintain and improve the information that is attached to ideas. Progress and completion reporting, community feedback and discussion and any justifications for changing an existing idea could be some of the most common types of information that is recorded and maintained over time that need ongoing consideration.



**Desirable outcomes**

* **Well maintained information** - Incentives should ideally be aligned with encouraging contributors to keep information about an idea up to date. This includes any reports about progress and completion, expanding on community feedback and discussion and ensuring some justifications are provided when the intended outcomes for an executed idea change.
* **Improved decision making** - Keeping information up to date during the execution of an idea can help with future decision making as voters will be more informed of how well the progress is going for ideas being executed in the ecosystem and whether more or less resources might be needed.
* **Reallocation of contribution effort** - New and relevant information being added to ideas being executed could help with making it easier for contributors to identify when new or existing ideas would benefit from more contribution efforts to generate a higher amount of impact for the ecosystem.



**Concerns**

* **Accurate information updates** - Much of the information that gets added to an idea as it is executed over time would be added by the contributors who are working on that idea. The incentives will need to consider how encourages and verifies that information updates are honest and correct. There is a risk that if incentives are closely attached to ideas it could create a stronger incentive alignment for contributors to exaggerate and positively promote how well an ideas execution is going if that meant it increased their chances of future compensation.
* **Information complexity** - Ideas with a larger scope or higher complexity could benefit from a large amount of information being added to keep voters up to date. Incentives to keep ideas up to date will need to balance the need for voters to be well informed on what is happening against voters becoming overwhelmed with too much information.



**Potential proposal submission incentive approaches**

* **No incentives** - Incentives aren’t necessarily required for keeping an idea up to date with relevant information such as progress or completion reports, any updates to the ideas execution approach or intended outcomes and providing feedback and discussion around the impact being generated. The incentive to keep an idea up to date with the right information could be handled at the execution stage where contributors who are selected to be compensated to help with execution would also be responsible for keeping ideas up to date. This could be a suitable option for keeping the incentive design simpler.
* **Performance incentives** - Compensation could rewarded to contributors that are highly effective at keeping an idea up to date with relevant information. This could be effective to help with quickly updating an ideas information so that voters are always well informed for future disbursement decisions.
* **Task incentives** - An incentive could be made available for each time that information gets added to an idea. This could help with incentivising a wider range of community members to keep an idea up to date rather than just the contributors who are executing an idea. The risk with this approach is that the incentives could lead to an overwhelming amount of information being added.
* **Time incentives** - Incentives could be used to compensate contributors for their time to help with keeping the information up to date about an idea. This could be useful for ensuring contributors are being very deliberate about the amount of time a contributor should ideally take when keeping an idea up to date and the information that they decide to add. This time incentive could be handled at the idea execution stage, having multiple time based incentives may be adding more complexity than necessary compared to the no incentive approach mentioned above.



## Idea execution

Once the most promising ideas are selected by the community the next step will be for contributors to start executing those ideas that can help with generating impact for the ecosystem. Incentives for handling the execution of ideas could be attached after ideas are selected or could be handled separately at the execution stage where contributors are selected to contribute towards ideas.



**Desirable outcomes**

* **Impactful ideas get executed** - Incentives should help with encouraging contributors to identify and execute the most promising ideas that can help with making the most impact for an ecosystem.
* **Measurable outcomes** - Executed ideas that can provably demonstrate the impact they have generated will be more useful for future disbursement decisions when voters are deciding how to allocate more treasury assets.
* **Flexibility** - Some ideas will generate large amounts of impact for an ecosystem where as others may struggle and become stagnant. It can be difficult to know ahead of time whether an idea will truly get the right response and adoption and then generate high levels of impact. It is due to this variability in what could actually happen that contributors will benefit from being able to be more flexible in how they execute ideas and what ideas they work on. Incentives could help through being focussed on the impact generated or by supporting high quality contributors that work across the most impactful ideas.
* **High participation and skill diversity** - Numerous ideas will require a certain amount of people with the right skill sets being available to execute an idea as intended. The incentives can be an effective way to attract enough contributors to the ecosystem to execute these ideas.



**Concerns**

* **Execution scope complexity** - The scope of execution for some ideas can be large and complex. If the incentives are attached to the idea through milestone or task incentives there is a risk of adding high levels of complexity for the proposers who must then accurately plan out the execution of an idea. The same planning could still be done however the complexity of attaching exact budgets to each step of an idea does not need to be attached to the idea.
* **Changing idea complexity** - Ideas can often change in how they are executed or new learnings can result in a change of the final outcome that gets produced. Incentives could potentially encourage or discourage how ideas are able to change and adapt over time. The execution process for ideas will need to be flexible enough to ensure contributors are able to respond to changing factors and environments and align there efforts with making as much impact as possible.
* **Stifling other forms of innovation** - If the incentives are only attached to the ideas selected by the voters there is a risk of stifling innovation that is not currently widely considered as a impactful idea. Not every idea will have the approval of enough of the voters before it is able to prove it will generate impact for the ecosystem. If funding is only available based on whether the idea is selected or not by the voters there is a risk of not funding important but misunderstood ideas. This problem could be prevented by instead funding high quality contributors who are able to work on different promising ideas.



**Potential execution incentive approaches**

* **No incentives** - The incentives for handling the execution of ideas could be handled at the execution stage where contributors are selected to be compensated for the execution of ideas. Not attaching the incentives to the idea could be an effective way for enabling contributors to be more flexible in the ideas they can work on.
* **Impact incentives** - If executed ideas generate a large amount of impact a certain amount of compensation could be rewarded to those that helped with contributing to its execution. Adding this incentive could be an effective way of encouraging contributors to identify the most impactful ideas to help execute. Incentives will also need to consider how this can be balanced as it may be detrimental if too many contributors try to work in a similar area due to this incentive.
* **Time incentives** - Incentives could be attached to the idea itself if the authors of the idea can state how long the idea will take and then contributors could then be paid periodically to execute an idea for that time length. The risk with this approach is it means the total time and budget for an idea must be planned ahead of time which adds complexity to the idea creation phase. If time incentives are just handled at the execution stage then contributors are paid for their time rather than the estimation time taken for an idea. The more complex an idea is the harder time based estimations become.
* **Milestones incentives -** Larger more complex ideas could benefit from being broken down into milestones. Attaching incentives to these milestones can help with increasing the accuracy of timings and therefore costs for the execution however this attempt at creating an accurate plan comes at the cost of the complexity in making those estimations and also handling any changes that happen along the way that mean the milestones might need to be updated or changed.
* **Performance incentives** - If an idea is executed more quickly than expected or to a very high standard then an incentive could be provided to the contributors involved. If this incentive was split evenly between contributors there may be conflict as there could be a contributor who put more effort into the execution of the idea than others. If this is the case then it may make more sense to instead attach the incentives for performance with the contributors at the execution stage rather than the idea stage.
* **Task incentives** - For simpler ideas a task incentive could be all that’s needed for contributors to participate and execute the idea. This would make sense when the scope and time required to execute the idea is more easily estimated and accurate.
