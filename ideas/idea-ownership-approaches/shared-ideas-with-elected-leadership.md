# Shared ideas with elected leadership

![](../../.gitbook/assets/shared-idea-with-elected-leadership.png)



**Overview**

Shared ideas with elected leadership can occur when the community is suggested an idea from members of the community and the leadership involved in managing the execution of the idea gets elected by that community. Any outcomes from the execution of that idea are not owned by the individuals involved in execution and instead the outcomes are for the benefit of the community.



**Low clarity of vision complexity (Score - 4)**

The election of leadership can help with lowering the complexity of achieving clarity of vision about the execution of an idea. The leadership could be responsible for making key decisions about the direction, execution and operation of an idea. Elected leadership could share a similar amount of complexity as owned ideas as the leadership in both ownership approaches will need to consider any community suggestions and feedback.



**Moderate governance decision complexity (Score - 3)**

A moderate amount of complexity would come from any decisions that get distributed across the wider community. Leadership that is elected could help with reducing the complexity for governance decisions that are more complex. As leadership would be elected there is further emphasis on the importance for leadership to respond to and represent the needs of the community who elected that leadership in the first place. Elected leadership for a shared idea could help with simplifying and guiding the governance processes however adopting an election based approach would help with making them more responsible for involving community opinion and suggestions.



**Very high change of leadership flexibility (Score - 5)**

If the community is unhappy with the leadership that is operating and executing an idea they would be able to elect new leadership to take over their responsibilities.



**High contributor participation flexibility (Score - 4)**

The elected leadership could be given responsibility for choosing which contributors are most suitable for working on the execution of an idea. This might be a suitable approach for more complex ideas where having too many contributors could be problematic. Leadership that is elected by the community will have an even greater need to be thorough in their decision making when deciding which contributors should join the execution efforts. Any decisions made that are deemed unfair could result in different leadership being elected. This can help increases the likelihood of contributors having high flexibility to join the execution of any shared idea providing they are able to show sufficient evidence that they would be a valuable contributor.



**Very low contribution outcomes openness risk (Score - 5)**

A shared idea is owned by the community meaning all contribution outcomes would be made public and freely available. This means all software, processes and insights should be open sourced and freely available. Any contribution outcomes are available for anyone in the community to iterate and experiment on themselves.
