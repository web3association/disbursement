# Owned ideas with fixed leadership

![](../../.gitbook/assets/owned-idea-with-fixed-leadership.png)



**Overview**

Owned ideas with fixed leadership are where the creators keep full control over the vision for the idea, the approach for execution and the contributors involved. The owners of the idea will make all of the key decisions when executing the idea and govern all of the systems and processes involved.



**Very low clarity of vision complexity (Score - 5)**

The owners of the idea have full control over the direction of the idea and exactly how it gets executed. Full control over the vision between a smaller number of people will minimise the clarity of vision complexity. Other contributors or the community would not be able to dispute or overrule the owners decision making and would be reliant on them accepting any suggestions made. The potential issues with central ownership over the vision is it could easily lead to less experimentation, any suggestions for improvements and further testing must be approved by the owners of the idea.



**Very low governance decision complexity (Score - 5)**

Any governance decisions are made by the smaller number of owners for the idea meaning the complexity is at its lowest. Only a small number of people would need to be informed when making important decisions. The owners could also invite participation in the governance decisions from a wider audience within the ecosystem, however this would be at the full discretion of the leadership, who could also easily revoke this approach at any point.



**Very low change of leadership flexibility (Score - 1)**

The community and other contributors involved in the execution of an owned idea would not be able to change the leadership as it is fixed. The only way that leadership could be changed is if a similar idea was executed by another team or the leadership voluntarily decided to migrate ownership of the idea to someone else or the community.



**Very low contributor participation flexibility (Score - 1)**

Contributors who are looking to participate in the idea would be reliant on the owners of the idea accepting their offer to contribute, the owners of the idea could also likely have been openly inviting contributors to join at that time.



**Very high contribution outcomes openness risk (Score - 1)**

If the owned idea is competing as a business opportunity there is a much higher risk that some or all of the contribution outcomes are not made publicly available. If there is source code or proprietary information that gives that team an advantage in the market they are less likely to share that publicly for the good of the community as this would reduce or even remove their advantage. Higher competition between competing teams could also lead to less collaboration and higher duplicated efforts.
