# Approaches for handling idea costs

There are a number of idea related costs that could be involved in the disbursement process. These costs could be handled in a number of different ways.

Some example idea related costs include:

* Hardware
* Production costs
* Real estate
* Rent or lease payments
* Software subscriptions
* Backup & data storage
* Office supplies
* Insurance
* Utilities
* Security services
* Education & training



## **Included in contributor proposal costs**

Most of these example idea costs could be integrated into contributor proposals which are handled in the execution process which is where contributors get selected. Hardware, rent or lease payments, software subscriptions, backup & data storage, office supplies, insurance, utilities, security services and education & training are examples of the costs that could be covered within the compensation provided to the contributor. The contributor can account for these costs when determining how much funding to request for their contribution efforts. Situations where this approach could be more problematic would be for larger fixed costs such as production costs or for real estate along with certain software subscriptions or security services. These situations could require a separate idea cost approval process to withdraw treasury funds for these specific idea related costs.



## **Idea & contributor combined proposals**

Both the fully combined process and the idea & contributor combined process would have any of their idea related costs included in the same proposal. The contributor and idea costs are both added to the same proposal for these approaches.



## Independent i**dea costs approval process**

During the execution of an idea costs can emerge over time. Some idea can benefit from having more progress in execution before accurate costs can be determined. Other times the costs for an idea are an unknown at the point of planning but become emergent outcome after time is spent executing an idea. The approval of idea costs could happen at the time an idea is selected or it could also need to happen at different points during execution. Due to the variety of reasons that an idea may have emergent or changing costs come up in the future during execution an independent idea cost approval process for handling this could be a suitable solution.



**Advantages**

* **Reduced idea complexity** - Adopting a separate process for approving idea costs means that ideas could be created more easily in an initial version of the idea without needing to plan out all of the potential associated costs. This reduced complexity for idea creation can help with speeding up the time it takes to create an idea and for that idea to receive feedback and discussion from the community. Quicker feedback for ideas can help with identifying which of those ideas are the most promising and that then could receive more or less contribution effort to improve them.
* **Higher voter choice** - Voters involved in the selection of ideas and the approval of idea costs can provide their exact preferences and response to the proposals in front of them. By adopting a separate process for approving idea costs voters can indicate when they approve of an idea but disapprove of some or all of the idea related costs. This ability for voters to vote exactly how they want to helps with making the system more expressive and responsive to the exact preferences and sentiment that each voter has for each idea.
* **Handles changing costs** - Costs can increase or decrease at the point of execution for each idea. New costs can emerge that were not previously needed due to a change of execution outcomes or a change in approach being taken to execute the idea. An independent idea cost approval process would enable any existing idea to request a change of existing funding or a request for new funding at the point that change occurs. Without this process existing ideas would need to make duplicated information and use the same idea process again to receive future funding.
* **Flexible request timing** - Idea costs could still be requested immediately at the point of idea submission if the costs are known ahead of time and can be properly calculated. Alternatively if the idea requires some initial execution efforts before the contributors will know the accurate costings the contributors involved in the execution would benefit from being able to request the costs at that point in which they are well informed. This flexibility allows for ideas to be gradually planned as and when the right information is available during the execution of an idea or as elements of the idea and the execution approach change that justify a change in costs.



**Disbursement approach considerations**

Both the fully combined process and the idea & contributors combined process approaches for disbursement have the idea and execution processes combined together. This means that the idea costs and contributor costs for execution are bundled together in the same proposal. Putting these costs together doesnâ€™t change the fact that the costs for these ideas could change over time or new ones emerge. Due to this these disbursement approaches can benefit from the proposers being able to update these requests or make new ones. If there was no separate process for approving fixed costs the proposer would need to submit a new proposal with the same priority, idea and contributor information to then receive funding for changing costs. Enabling a proposer to change the proposal and idea costs in anyway should still require approval from the voters as otherwise this could easily be abused by proposers. An ecosystem may prefer to take a rigid approach to cost planning in that it decides to not support any changing circumstances, however this could lead to more internal conflicts, over estimation of costings or simply mean letting projects fail or stagnate in their execution due to a lack of ability to respond to change factors and environments.



**Budgeting approach considerations**

Treasuries have a finite amount of assets they can use for disbursement. When disbursing these assets an ecosystem may want to limit the amount of assets that get used for idea costs against what gets used for contributor costs. For instance, it could be detrimental to have many ideas be approved that have many different idea costs attached if that meant that there was little funding left to pay for contributors to execute those ideas. If a disbursement process is adopting a fixed release of funds per round or fixed amount during a period of time they may decide to add a cap to the amount of that budget that can be used for idea costs or use a percentage split between idea costs and contributor costs. Using budget caps could also be a good safe guard for these disbursement processes whilst they are in the earlier stages of testing and experimentation.



**Contributor fraud and corruption considerations**

The risks around contributor fraud and corruption are relevant and require consideration irregardless of how idea costs are handled. Contributors involved in the execution of ideas could become corrupted or malicious during execution. If those contributors start requesting for idea costs to execute their idea this could be done so in bad faith where their real intention is to take the funds for themselves. One approach that could be adopted to help prevent this, especially for larger payments, is to use an escrow contract and a number of verification and moderation steps to slow down and check the disbursement of different costs that get approved. These checks could help with identifying the received address, verifying their ownership or control of the address, the value of any assets involved and exactly how any assets involved are being moved or changed in terms of ownership.
