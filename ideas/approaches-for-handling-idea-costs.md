# Approaches for handling idea costs

There are a number of idea related costs that could require funding from the disbursement process. These costs could be handled in a number of different ways.

Some example idea related costs include:

* Hardware
* Production costs
* Real estate
* Rent or lease payments
* Software subscriptions
* Backup & data storage
* Office supplies
* Insurance
* Utilities
* Security services
* Education & training



### **Included in contributor proposal costs**

Most of these example idea costs could be integrated into the costs for contributor proposals which are handled in the contributor process where contributors are selected and compensated for their contribution efforts. Hardware, rent or lease payments, software subscriptions, backup & data storage, office supplies, insurance, utilities, security services and education & training are examples of the costs that could be covered within the compensation provided to a contributor. The contributor can account for these costs when determining how much funding to request for their ongoing contribution efforts. Situations where this approach could be more problematic would be for larger fixed costs such as production costs, real estate costs, certain software subscriptions and security service costs. These situations could require a separate idea cost approval process to withdraw treasury funds for those specific idea related costs.



### **Attaching the incentives to ideas or priorities**

Incentives being attached to either the priorities or ideas being selected would mean that any idea cost could be added directly to the proposal budget. This means both the contributor and the idea costs would be added to the same proposal for those incentive approaches.



### **Separate idea costs approval process**

During the execution of an idea a number of new costs could emerge over time or changes to the already planned costs. Ideas can benefit from being executed for a period of time before accurate costs can be more easily determined. In some situations the costs for an idea could be unknown at the point of any initial planning. These costs might only become clear after time is spent executing the idea. The approval of idea costs could happen at the time an idea is selected or it could happen at different points during execution. Due to the variety of reasons that an idea may have emergent or changing costs come up in the future during execution an independent idea cost approval process for handling these situations could be a suitable solution regardless of which incentive approach is used.



**Advantages**

* **Reduced idea complexity** - Adopting a separate process for approving idea costs means that ideas could be created more easily in an initial version as they wouldn’t need to plan out all of the potential associated costs upfront. These costs could still be planned for in an idea immediately however the actual value requested doesn’t need to happen until this is needed in the short term. This reduced idea creation complexity can help with reducing the time needed to create an idea and for that idea to receive feedback and discussion from the community.
* **Higher voter choice** - Voters that are involved in the selection of ideas and the approval of idea costs can provide their exact preferences and response to the ideas being suggested. By adopting a separate process for approving idea costs voters can indicate when they approve of an idea but disapprove of some or all of the idea related costs being requested. This ability for voters to vote exactly how they want can help with making the system more expressive and responsive to the exact preferences and opinions of each voter.
* **Handles changing costs** - Costs can increase or decrease during different points of execution for each idea. New costs can emerge that were not previously needed due to a change of execution outcome or due to a change in approach being taken to execute the idea. A separate idea cost approval process would enable any existing idea to request funding for any change of idea costs at the point that this change occurs. Without this process existing ideas would need to make a similar proposal as they had to originally to get funding again.
* **Flexible request timing** - Idea costs could still be requested immediately at the point of idea submission if the costs are known ahead of time and can be properly calculated. Alternatively if the idea requires some initial execution efforts before the contributors will know the accurate costs the contributors involved in the execution would benefit from being able to request the costs at that point in which they become well informed. This flexibility allows for ideas to be planned over time in increasing detail as the right information becomes available during the execution of an idea or as elements of the idea and the execution approach change which then could justify a change in costs.
* **Timely and accurate cost justifications** - Adopting an independent approval process that handles the idea related costs outside of contribution effort means that all of those costs can be requested when they are needed with exact justifications and budgets. Ideas would not need to be fully planned out from a budget perspective and instead can be more exact and justified with the costs when these are needed.



**Incentive approach considerations**

Either of the idea or priority attached incentive approaches could have the idea related costs added to the proposals that outline the plan and budget for the idea(s) being executed. In those proposals the idea costs and contributor costs for execution are bundled together in the same proposal. Putting these costs together doesn’t change the fact that the costs for these ideas could change over time or that new costs could emerge. Due to this these disbursement approaches can benefit from the proposers being able to update these requests or make new ones. If there was no separate process for approving idea related costs the proposer would need to submit a new proposal with the same priority, idea and contributor information to then receive funding for changing costs. Enabling a proposer to change the proposal and idea costs in any way should still require approval from the voters as otherwise this could easily be abused by proposers. An ecosystem may prefer to take a rigid approach to cost planning in that it decides to not support any changing circumstances, however this could lead to more internal conflicts due to under or over estimations of costings, preventing any changes could also mean simply letting projects fail or stagnate during their execution efforts due to a lack of ability to respond to changing factors and environments.



**Budgeting approach considerations**

Treasuries have a finite amount of assets they can distribute during disbursement. When disbursing these assets an ecosystem may want to limit the amount of assets that get used for idea costs against what gets used for contributor costs. For instance, it could be detrimental to have many ideas be approved that have many a large amount of idea costs attached if that meant that there was little funding left to pay for contributors to execute those ideas. If a disbursement process has a fixed release of funds per round or fixed amount it will release during a period of time they could decide to add a cap to the amount of that available budget that could be used for idea related costs. Alternatively they could also consider adopting a percentage split approach between idea costs and contributor costs. Disbursement processes could also apply budget caps to prevent idea costs from exceeding certain values as a way to safeguard the disbursement process in earlier stages of testing and experimentation.



**Contributor fraud and corruption considerations**

The risks around contributor fraud and corruption are relevant and require consideration regardless of how idea costs are handled. Contributors involved in the execution of ideas could become corrupted or malicious during execution. If those contributors start requesting for idea costs to execute their idea this could be done so in bad faith where their real intention is to take the funds for themselves. One approach that could be adopted to help prevent this, especially for larger payments, is to use an escrow contract and a number of verification and moderation steps that help to slow down and check the disbursement of certain cost requests that need to be approved. These checks could help with identifying the received address, verifying their ownership or control of the address, the value of any assets involved and exactly how any assets involved are being moved or changed in terms of ownership.
