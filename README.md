**Disbursement resources**

These resources are aimed at thinking about the disbursement process for treasury systems. Content will cover areas such as the approaches which could be used to disperse funds and the implications of each one, what is happening in existing systems and how that relates to web 3 ecosystems and analysis on what the data is showing such as the return on investment and overall performance of different treasuries.
