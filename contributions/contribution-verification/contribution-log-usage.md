# Contribution log usage

Contributions can be recorded so that individuals and teams are able to share a list of their ongoing contribution efforts. Contribution logs could record a persons contribution efforts or a group of contributors efforts together. Contribution logs can be useful for Web3 ecosystems in a number of different ways.



**Contribution outcome verification**

Contribution logs can be an effective way to record and verify whether an individual or project has been making useful contribution efforts. Contribution logs could record the efforts towards a single idea or for a number of different ideas being executed in the ecosystem. Verifying contribution outcomes at different stages of idea development can help with identifying malicious actors or poor performers sooner than later. Contributors receiving funding to execute ideas can also be required to have their previous contribution efforts verified before the next round of funding is distributed to them. This can help to better protect the treasuries assets from being stolen or misused.



**Performance measurement**

Contribution logs can help with measuring and comparing contribution efforts from different contributors. Measurable contribution efforts can help with grouping contributors based on the quality of their contributions and their overall performance. Accurate performance measurement can help with more accurately rewarding the most high performing contributors.



**Impact measurement**

Some contribution outcomes can be more impactful than others. Knowing which contributors are responsible for each contribution outcome can help with identifying and rewarding the contributors who have been the most consistent and effective at allocating their time towards the initiatives that have helped to generate the most impact for the ecosystem.



**Reputation building**

Contribution logs are a great way for contributors to build up their reputation around certain skill sets across one or many ecosystems. Recording contribution efforts so that other people can verify those outcomes means it can become easier over time for others to identify the most prominent skills and competencies of each contributor. Contributors that build up a reputation of being a highly performant contributor through a provable history of contribution efforts could use that reputation to more easily move between projects and ecosystems due to this reputation. Contribution logs could become a replacement for CVs and interview tests. A software developer for instance could make contributions to an ecosystems code base and prove their competencies through their open source code commits rather than taking a tech test in an interview process. This is beneficial to the contributor as the reputation stays with them for their whole career, it’s beneficial for the ecosystem as they get impactful contributions and it’s valuable for projects interested in working with this software developer as they get to see how the developer works in real life scenarios. Contributors having self ownership over their reputation is also an effective way to push more of the power to the edges so that intermediaries such as project owners or leadership roles do not become highly influential in determining someones compensation. Instead the proof of a contributors value can be made publicly available and the value of that reputation and proof of contribution is owned by the contributor.



**Social trust networks**

Contributors could make attestations about other contributors and their contributions. This could include comments, reviews or statements about the contribution efforts someone else has made. Attestations could provide valuable information and insights to other people. These interlinking connections between contributors and the different contribution related information could help with building trust based networks where people can more easily collaborate with other contributors due to the mutual connections they both share and the attestations those contributors have received from those shared connections.



**Detailed contribution insights**

Having an increasingly comprehensive record of contribution efforts could help with creating highly insightful information about an individual contributor or a cohort of contributors. Contribution log data could be highly useful for looking at a cohorts performance and impact or for identifying any gaps in contribution effort or skill sets that might be missing.



**Historical contribution comparisons**

Making contribution efforts easier to measure and compare with other contribution efforts means that better historical comparisons can be made. These comparisons could become increasingly useful to an ecosystem over time. An ecosystem could look at how the performance of contributors as a whole is changing over time as different factors change such as the amount of compensation being offered, the tools, processes and infrastructure they use when contributing, the total number of contributors in the ecosystem and the average duration of each contributor's participation. Making contribution outcomes easier to measure and compare makes it possible for an ecosystem to identify the trends more accurately that are most correlated with improving contributor performance. As one example, if a new incentive was introduced to improve the performance of contributors, having a way to measure the change in output over time will help to produce insightful data that could help with better determining whether that new incentive was actually effective or not.
