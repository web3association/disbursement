# Contribution verification

Web3 treasuries are increasingly becoming more valuable over time and along with this the amount of funding they are disbursing is also usually increasing with it. Many of the initiatives that an ecosystem wants to execute can take longer than a months worth of contribution effort. Executing complex ideas can span multiple months or years and involve numerous phases of development.

Ecosystems that disburse large amounts of treasury assets ahead of time to pay for these initiatives face an increasing risk that the contributors involved in executing those ideas could abuse or steal the funding they receive. The larger the amount of funding the larger this risk there is to the ecosystems treasury assets.

Recording and verifying contribution outcomes is one way that this problem can be avoided. Instead of disbursing a large amount of assets ahead of time in a single transaction the ecosystem can distribute this funding over a number of smaller increments. Splitting up the contribution efforts into different milestones and time periods means that any recorded contribution outcomes can be verified and measured before any future funding is then released.

Protecting ecosystem treasury assets is a foundational reason why contribution outcomes should be recorded and verified so that the ecosystems treasury assets can be better safe guarded from malicious actors.
