# Individual monthly contribution logs

Exploring how to make [contribution efforts more measurable](contribution-measurement.md) and comparing different [contribution verification approaches](../../disbursement-approaches/contribution-verification-approaches/) led to the conclusion that individual monthly contribution logs could be a highly effective approach for recording, measuring and verifying contribution efforts. This approach can help with making it far easier to compare peoples contribution efforts across an ecosystem and also compare how the performance of each individual changes over time as more contribution logs get submitted.

## **Individual contribution measurement is often unavoidable**

Many ideas such as applications, protocols, community efforts and many other initiatives can often require a number of different contributors to help with executing those ideas. All of these initiatives will need to fairly determine how the people involved in executing that idea should be paid for their contribution efforts.

If contribution efforts are not measured in any capacity it will be difficult to know who has done what work and who has done the most work overall. It would be difficult to know who has performed the most effectively when executing the idea and who has made the most impactful contributions. This outcome is problematic as this could mean hard working and high performing contributors aren’t correctly rewarded for their effort. These actors could simply decide to not work with this group of contributors in the future due to this or could alternatively just not work as hard as their efforts weren’t recognised. Not monitoring or recording contribution efforts could also mean it becomes more difficult to spot which contributors are not performing well and not contributing as effectively as they could be.

When contribution efforts are not recorded the process of verifying and measuring peoples contribution efforts can end up being pushed towards certain individuals in the group such as project owners. This outcome gives those individuals more power and influence over what each individual will be compensated. Alternatively, if the decision process for what people get paid was democratic then the main issue with a lack of recorded contribution efforts is that people would need to be much more aware of what everyone has been working on to make an informed decision on what is fair and reasonable.

Recording contribution efforts improves both of these scenarios. If a small group of individuals have more influence over how much contributors get paid the contribution logs would provide more evidence to fairly determine the value of peoples contribution efforts. The contributors would have a more reliable way to prove their value. In a democratic decision process for distributing compensation the contributors would all benefit from having more access to accurate contribution logs that showcase what each of them have been working on. Understanding how people have contributed towards an idea can become a foundational source of information to make informed decisions about who has been the most performant and effective in the team.

Recorded contribution efforts can help with improving future decisions about how compensation is distributed based on each individual's performance and the impact they made. Improving the accuracy and measurability of the contribution logs can help with better aligning the incentives to reward the individuals that have been the most hard working and performant. Making it easier to record, verify and present these contribution logs can make it easier to reward contributors based on the merits of their contribution outcomes rather than this process being a popularity contest or biassed to certain individuals over others.



## **Steps for recording individual contributions**



**1. Automatically recorded contributions**

Automatically recorded contributions are a great foundation for creating contribution logs. Digital contributions such as code commits, designs and written submissions can be automatically tracked and tied to the account holder who made those contributions. Digital contributions such as these can be recorded and verified more easily. Automatically recorded contribution logs alone could be very insightful for understanding what each contributor has been working on.



**2. Manually recorded contributions**

Any contributions that are not automatically recorded and verified could be added onto a contribution log as a manual submission. Manual contributions could include in person event attendance, collaboration efforts or research efforts that didn’t produce a digitally recorded outcome that can be more easily verified. These contributions could be self reported and verified where possible. If contribution efforts cannot be verified the weighting in terms of the usefulness and reliability of this submission would naturally be lower.



**3. Peer to peer attestations**

Contributors often work with other contributors when they help with executing different ideas. These contributors can create attestations about other people's contribution efforts. These attestations could create a more clearer image on how contributors have been working together and how each person's contributions have impacted others. Peer to peer attestations can add more clarity and evidence around the relevance and impact of different peoples contribution efforts. Peer to peer attestations do have the risk of people trying to game this system to try and financially benefit themselves by lying about what they have worked on and trying to get fraudulent attestations from others. Checks and balances will be needed to help mitigate this risk.



**4. Peer review**

Individuals that don’t actively work with some of the contributors in the ecosystem could still have relevant expertise and experience that might be useful for reviewing the contributions that others have made in the ecosystem. Peer review of the contribution efforts made by other groups and individuals can help to highlight opportunities for improvements, new ideas and help with identifying bad actors who could be trying to abuse the system in some way. Peer review could also be done over a longer time period to review what impact has been generated by different contributors over time. Impact could be generated slowly over time and it might not be obvious how an executed idea will make an impact across the ecosystem. A peer review process could explore the impact that these contributions have made over different time periods. Peer review of other people's contribution efforts could be an effective way to improve the accuracy in identifying the top performers and ensuring that they are fairly compensated for their performance and impact that they have generated for the ecosystem.



## **Advantages of individual monthly contribution logs**



**Easier contribution verification**

In group based contribution logs it can be easier to hide poor performance as the contribution logs won’t necessarily break down who has been working on what and provide any sufficient evidence. Logging an individual's contribution efforts can be a more effective solution for verifying that each individual involved in a project is actually making sufficient contribution efforts towards executing that idea. If contribution efforts are recorded every month this can also make it easier to compare those outcomes with other contributors. Monthly logs help to make the logs more measurable, which can help with making it easier to identify the best and weakest performers. Support could be provided to contributors that need to improve their performance. If the performance of a contributor doesn’t improve or the individual is purposefully being a bad actor then it would be unlikely that they receive future funding due to the evidence of poor performance shown in their contribution logs.



**Improved decision making**

Measurable contribution logs can help with making it easier for voters to spot the best and worst performers amongst a group of contributors. It can also help with identifying trends in the performance of contributors as a whole or where certain skill sets might be missing. This information can help with improving future disbursement decisions about where to allocate more resources and focus. Individual monthly contribution logs also become increasingly useful over time where a contributor will build up a reputation based on their contribution history. These logs can help with making voting decisions even easier over time as the community will simply be able to repeatedly select and fund the most performant contributors in the ecosystem.



**Retaining top performers**

Every idea won’t be successful and some teams won’t perform well together. Individual contribution logs can help to identify the most performant contributors in those situations where an idea fails or where there is a breakdown in a team's communication. Contribution logs would help to provide evidence of which contributors were the most effective in those teams. If those contributors can more easily prove they were effective at executing ideas it will be easier for them to be considered as a good candidate to help with other better performing ideas and teams.



**Higher self awareness & accountability**

If contributors can easily see their own performance against other contributors they are able to become more aware and self accountable for trying to achieve a similar or higher level of contribution output as the other contributors in the ecosystem.



**Empowers individual contributors**

Being able to demonstrate high performance or impactful contribution outcomes is empowering for building a contributors reputation. Competent and high performing contributors that are able to easily demonstrate their capabilities and performance should be able to more easily receive fair compensation for their efforts. Rewarding contributors who are working harder or more effectively than others is an important way that the available incentives can be more effectively aligned with generating impact for the ecosystem. Another way that evidence of contribution efforts can help to empower the individual is that it provides a public facing record that demonstrates what a contributor has achieved and what skill sets they are most competent at. This can make it easier for different teams and projects to verify that a contributor is well suited to help them with their own execution efforts. The easier it is for an individual to prove their ability and competencies the more control and influence they will have on being able to pick the most suitable initiatives for them to collaborate on that they are most interested in. Their reputation will also help with ensuring that they will get paid fairly for their skill level.



**Removed intermediaries**

Web3 ecosystems have the opportunity to make a more democratic and peer reviewed process for assessing performance and impact. Achieving this can help to remove intermediaries such as management and leadership positions that could have had excessive amounts of control and influence over determining someone else's compensation. Effective contribution measurement can help with creating a more open and free market for individuals to compete in. Self ownership of contribution data can more easily be used to then influence the compensation a contributor receives and their career trajectory. More self ownership of contribution data can help with preventing individuals or small groups of individuals from being able to unfairly determine someone else’s value. Individual contribution logs can help with pushing power to edges by enabling contributors to have more ownership over their data and reputation.



## **Opportunities for Web3 ecosystems**



**Open source contribution data**

Open source contributions data could help with creating highly insightful data to better understand the performance of a contributor or cohort of contributors. Public contribution data could help with identifying skills gaps and areas of improvement that the contributors could work on to become more performant or to generate more impact. Measurable contribution data will become increasingly valuable over time as now historical comparisons can be made and these learnings can then lead to more experiments that identify system and process improvements.



**Self sovereign identity**

Individual contribution logs can be attached to the identity of the contributors who submit these logs. These logs could be a great way to build up useful identity tooling within an ecosystem. Contributors could start submitting contribution logs to start building their own reputation at any time. Permissionless identity tooling with verifiable contribution logs could really help with enabling emerging talent to get recognised and rewarded for their efforts. Talent contributors could come from anywhere in the world.



**Trust based networks**

Verifiable contribution data could be used to initiate a form of trust based network that people use to prove someone's competency and reliability. Communities could start using this information as a form of identification and a way to trust certain individuals due to the reputation they’ve built and the common connections they share. These networks of provable contribution efforts could lead to new working arrangements being made between contributors based on the trust in these verified contributions. These emerging networks could result in a number of new use cases and ideas that are difficult to predict ahead of time.
