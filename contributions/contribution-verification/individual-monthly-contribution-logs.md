# Individual monthly contribution logs

## **Making contribution logs more measurable**



**Execution scope**

Grouping the type of work that is being completed is one way to try and increase measurability. Keeping a contribution log focused on a certain skill set such as coding or design could help with making it easier to compare and understand how different contributors have executed certain outcomes versus other contributors. The challenge with trying to make the execution scope more measurable is that each idea being executed is usually different from other ideas and thus can require different skills and expertise to execute them. Executing these different ideas can also produce very different outcomes. Infrastructure and protocol development for instance could have a lot of variation in how the different problems are solved and what skills are required when developing the code.



**Time**

Contribution outcomes could be recorded within a certain time period so that there is more consistency in the amount of work that is being completed within each contribution log. This helps to increase measurability as now individuals can be more easily compared based on the same duration of contribution time.



**Number of people**

If the contribution outcomes come from multiple people and are being combined into the same contribution log this would make it more difficult to understand who did what and how performant and impactful each of their contributions were. Keeping contribution outcomes recorded separately as individual contributions can help with making it easier to measure the differences between one person's contribution outputs with other contributors.



## **Individual monthly contribution logs**

Recording one person's contribution efforts at a time and recording contributions within a fixed time period, such as monthly, are the two stand out approaches mentioned above that could consistently help with making contribution efforts more measurable. In terms of execution scope, it is more difficult to separate out every type of contribution effort into separate submissions. However the execution scope could at least be improved by tagging the skills that are being used when recording these contribution efforts. For instance, design and code contributions could be recorded and tagged separately to make it clearer about what different skill sets have been used.

## **Individual contribution measurement is often unavoidable**

Many ideas such as applications, protocols, community efforts and many other initiatives can often require a number of different contributors to help with executing those ideas. All of these initiatives will need to fairly determine how the people involved in executing that idea should be paid for their contribution efforts.

If contribution efforts are not measured in any capacity it will be difficult to know who has done what work and who has done the most work overall. It would be difficult to know who has performed the most effectively when executing the idea and who has made the most impactful contributions. This outcome is problematic as this could mean hard working and high performing contributors aren’t correctly rewarded for their effort. These actors could simply decide to not work with this group of contributors in the future due to this or could alternatively just not work as hard as their efforts weren’t recognised. Not monitoring or recording contribution efforts could also mean it becomes more difficult to spot which contributors are not performing well and not contributing as effectively as they could be.

When contribution efforts are not recorded the process of verifying and measuring peoples contribution efforts can end up being pushed towards certain individuals in the group such as project owners. This outcome gives those individuals more power and influence over what each individual will be compensated. Alternatively, if the decision process for what people get paid was democratic then the main issue with a lack of recorded contribution efforts is that people would need to be much more aware of what everyone has been working on to make an informed decision on what is fair and reasonable.

Recording contribution efforts improves both of these scenarios. If a small group of individuals have more influence over how much contributors get paid the contribution logs would provide more evidence to fairly determine the value of peoples contribution efforts. The contributors would have a more reliable way to prove their value. In a democratic decision process for distributing compensation the contributors would all benefit from having more access to accurate contribution logs that showcase what each of them have been working on. Understanding how people have contributed towards an idea can become a foundational source of information to make informed decisions about who has been the most performant and effective in the team.

Recorded contribution efforts can help with improving future decisions about how compensation is distributed based on each individual's performance and the impact they made. Improving the accuracy and measurability of the contribution logs can help with better aligning the incentives to reward the individuals that have been the most hard working and performant. Making it easier to record, verify and present these contribution logs can make it easier to reward contributors based on the merits of their contribution outcomes rather than this process being a popularity contest or biassed to certain individuals over others.



## **Opportunities for Web3 ecosystems**



**Open source contribution data**

Open source contributions can help with creating insightful data that makes it easier to analyse the performance of a contributor or cohort of contributors. Public contribution data can help with identifying skills gaps and areas of improvement that the contributors could work on to become more performant or to generate more impact.



**Self owned contribution logs**

Contributors that have more ownership over their contribution logs can more easily influence and benefit from their own reputation that they build up over time. These contributors would be able to publicly showcase their contribution efforts and the impact they have generated.



**Removed intermediaries**

Web3 ecosystems have the opportunity to make a more democratic and peer reviewed process for assessing performance and impact. Achieving this can help to remove intermediaries such as management and leadership positions that can have an excessive amount of control and influence over determining someone else's value and compensation. Effective contribution measurement can help with creating a more open and free market for individuals to compete in. Contributors' self owned contribution data can more easily be used to then influence the compensation they receive and their career trajectory. More self ownership of contribution data can help with preventing individuals or small groups of individuals from being able to unfairly determine someone else’s value.



**Trust based networks**

Verifiable contribution data could be used to create a trust based network that people use to prove someone's competency and reliability. Communities could start using this information as a form of identification and a way to trust certain individuals due to the reputation they’ve built and the common connections they share. These networks of provable contribution efforts could lead to new working arrangements being made between contributors based on the trust in these verified contributions.
