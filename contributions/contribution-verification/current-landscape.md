## **Company contribution measurement**

Some companies can have very few processes in place for verifying an employee's contribution efforts and instead might rely on the observations of leadership and management. Other companies might have very thorough processes in place for identifying and rewarding performance and impactful contributions. Observations from leadership and management can be a faster and simpler approach. Smaller companies may use this more often as it can be easier and there are a limited number of employee contribution efforts to review. Processes for reviewing contribution efforts and performance become increasingly more important for larger teams and bigger companies due to the complexity of working out how peoples compensation should change over time and which contributors have been the most performant and impactful. If top performers are not adequately rewarded there is a risk they move to another company. The problem with observations of someone's contribution efforts is it requires a higher amount of trust in the leadership's decision making. These observations would determine what employees are paid based on their contribution efforts. This can be a faster and simpler process to monitor and verify contribution efforts however this can come at the expense of the accuracy in measuring each person's contribution efforts and introduces the risk that some employees might not get compensated fairly for their performance or that the leadership is biased towards certain individuals over others. Companies that have more employees and processes for performance measurement in place will use these processes to identify and compensate employees for their efforts. This could come in the form of job promotions or salary increases based on skill based pay bands. One off incentives could include bonuses or stock options. Companies with more structure and process can be more accurate with grouping employees into different levels of skill and performance however these processes can also be limiting for employees who exceed those expectations and their higher performance is not well captured in a more rigid process.



**Issues with company contribution measurability**

* **Easier exploitation** - For companies that use more trust in the leadership instead of a formal process for measuring performance and contribution efforts there is an increased risk that employees could be exploited for their skills and performance as they would be relying on another person's judgement rather than a defined performance process. Leadership could try to retain more revenue for the business or inaccurately review someone's performance and contributions. Employees might need to dispute the leadership's judgement if they felt like they deserved more compensation due to their performance.
* **Lack of measurement accuracy** - Companies that haven’t implemented any process for measuring and verifying employee contribution efforts and performance have an increased risk of lower accuracy around compensation decisions due to a lack of awareness and understanding of each person's contributions and performance. A lack of process means the company would be relying heavily on observational efforts and outcomes. These observations could lack the full information and context needed to know what has actually happened.
* **Lack of public and self owned contribution logs** - Contribution efforts that aren’t publicly recorded and owned by the employees mean there is limited value in these logs for the employees. Employees could have benefited from being able to prove that they have made certain contributions for the business that they could then showcase to others across the company or even to other external companies. One obvious reason that companies would not inherently want this openness of competencies and performance is because it would increase the potential risk that other companies try to pouch their top performing employees.
* **Separate process for leadership and management** - Some companies might not apply the same verification process for contributions and performance on management and leadership as they do with employees. This can be unfair for employees as each person's contributions to the company are not being treated equally in terms of how they are recorded, measured and verified. A lack of equal process can lead to inaccurate or unfair compensation outcomes. Employees could have been far more performant and impactful than the leadership roles yet the employees might not receive fair recognition and compensation for those contribution efforts.
* **Rigid incentive process** - Companies that do have a thorough process for measuring and verifying contribution efforts have the risk that their process could be overly rigid. Some employees may exceed the value and expectations of defined compensation thresholds or generate impact in ways that aren’t well accounted for in the verification process. Making a process that is flexible enough to handle different outcomes and contribution efforts would be an important part of rewarding the top performers fairly and aligning the incentives with the employees who have been the most performant and impactful.



## **Professional sports contribution measurement**

Professional sports provide a great comparison to company environments in terms of how contribution is measured. Sports are far more measurable than many employee roles found in company environments. Sports have a clear objective in what outcomes lead to a winning outcome. The individuals involved in those sports can be measured accurately in terms of their performance and contributions towards generating a winning outcome. Football is a great example to consider. Each team member can have their contributions measured such as how long they have the ball, number of passes, number of shots and shots on target, number of ball interceptions and many more different metrics. These numerical measurements can then be paired up with visually recorded data about how these players move around the pitch, their spatial awareness and how they interact with other players on the pitch. The value in these measurements is that these players can be more easily grouped based on their performance and that performance can lead to an increase in compensation for the top performers. Sports athletes, especially those in team sports, benefit from their measurements being fully public and widely accessible as now every other team can easily verify someone's performance and impact.



**Top performing contributors**

Top performing sports athletes are often paid a meaningful amount more than other athletes. For individual sports the contribution measurement is less valuable as the individual is responsible entirely for any wins or losses and the contribution efforts don’t need to be compared with other team members. For team sports contribution measurement is far more valuable as if the team wins it is beneficial to understand which players have been the most performant and effective at helping that team achieve its victory. Measuring these contribution efforts effectively will mean the most impactful players can be compensated the most so that they are better rewarded for their performance.



## **Comparisons between sports and company contribution environments**

Sports are inherently more easy to measure numerically and visually than many common company roles such as software development, product management, design and marketing. Roles that exist in companies do not have the same simple objective that sports do. Employees can make an impact in a multitude of ways and also make a wide range of contributions that have different implications on the short term and long term success of an executed idea. However the difference in the ease of contribution measurability does not diminish the fact that increasing contribution measurability can be highly beneficial for more accurately rewarding the most performant and impactful contributors. Increasing the contribution measurability in any environment will help with more effectively identifying and rewarding the top performers in a group environment. The less effective a company is at measuring the contribution efforts of employees the more there is a risk of inaccurate compensation outcomes and environments where leadership and management can more easily make unfair or biassed compensation decisions.
