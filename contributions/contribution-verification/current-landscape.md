## **Company contribution measurement**

Smaller companies that have fewer resources and capacity often have simpler processes and structures in place in their daily operation. Trust in leadership decision making can play a more important role in deciding what employees are paid based on their contribution efforts and performance. Companies that put more trust into the leadership and management roles to make these decisions can get the benefit of a faster and simpler process to monitor and verify contribution efforts and then make compensation decisions. However this can come at the expense of the accuracy in measuring peoples contribution efforts and the risk that some employees might not get compensated fairly for their performance. Larger companies that have more employees and capacity sometimes have more well defined processes and structures in place to handle this complexity of measuring and verifying the progress of each employee. These performance review processes help to determine what level of compensation is fair for each employee's skill level and contribution effort. Increased compensation could come in the form of promotions, stock options or bonus compensation. Companies with more structure and process can be more accurate when grouping people into different levels of skill and performance however these processes could also be limiting for employees who exceed those expectations and don’t fit well into a rigid process that could not be reflective of the impact they are generating.



**Issues with company contribution measurability**

* **Easier exploitation** - In environments that use more trust in the leadership instead of a formal process there is an increased risk that employees could be exploited for their skill level and performance as they would be relying on another person's judgement rather than a defined performance process. Employees might need to dispute the leadership's judgement if they felt like they deserved more compensation for their performance.
* **Lack of measurement accuracy** - Companies that haven’t implemented any process for measuring and verifying employee contribution efforts and performance have an increased risk that the accuracy of any decisions about compensation could be inaccurate due to a lack of awareness and understanding of each person's contributions. A lack of process means the company would be relying heavily on observational outcomes. These observations could lack a full understanding of what has actually happened.
* **Lack of public and self owned contribution logs** - Contribution efforts that aren’t publicly recorded and owned by the employees mean there is a reduced value for the employees. Employees could have benefited from being able to prove that they have made certain contributions for the business and to showcase this value to others across the company or even to other external companies. One obvious reason that companies might not want this openness of competencies and performance is it would empower the individual at the company's potential expense of losing that top talent.
* **Separate process for leadership and management** - Some companies might not apply the same performance measurement process on management and leadership as they do with employees. This can be unfair for the employees as each person's contributions to the company are not being treated equally in terms of how they are recorded, measured and verified. A lack of equal process can lead to inaccurate compensation outcomes. Employees could have been far more performant and impactful than the leadership roles yet the employees might not receive fair compensation for those contribution efforts.
* **Rigid incentive process** - Companies that do have a thorough process for measuring and verifying contribution efforts to reward the best performers have the risk that their process is overly rigid. Some employees may exceed the value and expectations of different compensation thresholds or generate impact in ways that aren’t well accounted for in the performance process. Making a process that is flexible enough to handle different outcomes and contribution efforts will be an important part of rewarding the top performers fairly and aligning the incentives with the employees who have been the most performant and impactful.



## **Professional sports contribution measurement**

Professional sports provide a great comparison to company environments in terms of how contribution is measured. Sports are far more measurable than many employee roles found in company environments. Sports have a clear objective in what outcomes lead to a winning outcome. The individuals involved in those sports can be measured accurately in terms of their performance and contributions towards generating a winning outcome. Football is a great example to consider. Each team member can have their contributions measured such as how long they have the ball, number of passes, number of shots and shots on target, number of ball interceptions and many more different metrics. These numerical measurements can then be paired up with visually recorded data about how these players move around the pitch, their spatial awareness and how they interact with other players on the pitch. The value in these measurements is that these players can be more easily grouped based on their performance and that performance can lead to an increase in compensation for the top performers. Sports athletes, especially those in team sports, benefit from their measurements being fully public and widely accessible as now every other team can easily verify someone's performance and impact.



**Top performing contributors**

Top performing sports athletes are often paid a meaningful amount more than other athletes. For individual sports the contribution measurement is less valuable as the individual is responsible entirely for any wins or losses and the contribution efforts don’t need to be compared with other team members. For team sports contribution measurement is far more valuable as if the team wins it is beneficial to understand which players have been the most performant and effective at helping that team achieve its victory. Measuring these contribution efforts effectively will mean the most impactful players can be compensated the most so that they are better rewarded for their performance.



## **Comparisons between sports and company contribution environments**

Sports are inherently more easy to measure numerically and visually than many common company roles such as software development, product management, design and marketing. Roles that exist in companies do not have the same simple objective that sports do. Employees can make an impact in a multitude of ways and also make a wide range of contributions that have different implications on the short term and long term success of an executed idea. However the difference in the ease of contribution measurability does not diminish the fact that increasing contribution measurability can be highly beneficial for more accurately rewarding the most performant and impactful contributors. Increasing the contribution measurability in any environment will help with more effectively identifying and rewarding the top performers in a group environment. The less effective a company is at measuring the contribution efforts of employees the more there is a risk of inaccurate compensation outcomes and environments where leadership and management can more easily make unfair or biassed compensation decisions.
