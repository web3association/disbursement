# Contribution measurement

Making contribution logs more measurable can help to improve their usefulness and value. Increased measurability means it becomes easier to compare contribution logs between different contributors and make historical comparisons to see who has been the most performant and whether individuals and groups of contributors are getting more performant or not over time. Higher measurability can increase the accuracy in identifying the top performers who can then be rewarded for that performance and impact they generate.



## **Contribution recording approaches**



**Automatically recorded contributions**

Some contribution efforts can be recorded automatically and provide evidence of what a contributor has been working on. Many digital based contributions can be quantifiable and verifiable such as code contributions, designs, articles, blogs and documentation changes. Online recorded meetings could even be eventually automatically transcribed and verified to prove someone's attendance and contributions towards a discussion.



**Manually recorded contributions**

It could be challenging to make automatic recordings for every single contribution someone makes. In person events, meetings or other forms of mentorship and leadership could be more difficult to record without adding a manual submission that covers the contribution effort. Contributions that are added manually by a contributor or community member can benefit from having attestations attached to those claims. Other community members could vouch for the contributions made by others. This can be a useful approach to cover the types of contributions that exist which are harder to verify. The identities of the community members giving these attestations would need to be verified and trusted for these attestations to become more reliable.



**Observationally recorded contributions**

Contributors that work with other contributors are able to observe some of the contribution outcomes and impact that other contributors generate. Companies may often use this approach where they don’t actively record the contribution efforts of each individual and instead a manager is observing the efforts and outcomes that people are generating over time. The problem with this approach is if the person doing the observations is given too much of the control to do all of the performance and impact measurement they are given a large amount of influence and power over determining peoples value and compensation. If contribution efforts can be logged and owned by the individual who made them there is higher usability of that information for the contributor as they can now more easily prove their competencies and value to others. More trust is needed in management when using an observational approach to monitor and verify contribution efforts.



### **Measuring recorded contributions**

All the contribution recording approaches mentioned above could be used for recording someone's contribution efforts. Automatically recorded contribution outcomes are the most desirable approach for capturing contribution information as it can provide the strongest evidence about what a contributor has actually worked on. Automatic contribution records can help with removing the risks around incorrect or exaggerated efforts that are manually being recorded. Automated contribution records can also reduce or even remove the time needed for a contributor to record their contribution efforts. Manually recorded contributions are an important addition to automatically recorded contributions as they can fill in the gaps for areas that are not as easy to automatically record. Manually recorded contributions can help with providing the full information about someone's contributions. Processes are needed that have the right checks and balances in place and the right incentive design to make sure these self recorded contributions get verified. There will always be a risk that someone tries to game this system in an attempt to unfairly improve their own reputation and future chance of receiving funding. Making it easier for individuals to record their contribution efforts can create an opportunity to reduce any ambiguity about how much contribution effort someone has made and how performant and impactful their contribution outcomes have been for an ecosystem. More tools and processes will be needed to effectively record and verify the contribution efforts someone has made. Contributors could greatly benefit from building up a history of contribution logs as it can help to give them more control and ownership over their reputation by making it easier for them to demonstrate their experience and competencies through their contributions.



## **Steps for recording individual contributions**



**1. Automatically recorded contributions**

Automatically recorded contributions are a great foundation for creating contribution logs. Digital contributions such as code commits, designs and written submissions can be automatically tracked and tied to the account holder who made those contributions. Digital contributions such as these can be recorded and verified more easily. Automatically recorded contribution logs alone could be very insightful for understanding what each contributor has been working on.



**2. Manually recorded contributions**

Any contributions that are not automatically recorded and verified could be added onto a contribution log as a manual submission. Manual contributions could include in person event attendance, collaboration efforts or research efforts that didn’t produce a digitally recorded outcome that can be more easily verified. These contributions could be self reported and verified where possible. If contribution efforts cannot be verified the weighting in terms of the usefulness and reliability of this submission would naturally be lower.



**3. Peer to peer attestations**

Contributors often work with other contributors when they help with executing different ideas. These contributors can create attestations about other people's contribution efforts. These attestations could create a more clearer image on how contributors have been working together and how each person's contributions have impacted others. Peer to peer attestations can add more clarity and evidence around the relevance and impact of different peoples contribution efforts. Peer to peer attestations do have the risk of people trying to game this system to try and financially benefit themselves by lying about what they have worked on and trying to get fraudulent attestations from others. Checks and balances will be needed to help mitigate this risk.



**4. Peer review**

Individuals that don’t actively work with some of the contributors in the ecosystem could still have relevant expertise and experience that might be useful for reviewing the contributions that others have made in the ecosystem. Peer review of the contribution efforts made by other groups and individuals can help to highlight opportunities for improvements, new ideas and help with identifying bad actors who could be trying to abuse the system in some way. Peer review could also be done over a longer time period to review what impact has been generated by different contributors over time. Impact could be generated slowly over time and it might not be obvious how an executed idea will make an impact across the ecosystem. A peer review process could explore the impact that these contributions have made over different time periods. Peer review of other people's contribution efforts could be an effective way to improve the accuracy in identifying the top performers and ensuring that they are fairly compensated for their performance and impact that they have generated for the ecosystem.



## **Making contribution logs more measurable**



**Execution scope**

Grouping the type of work that is being completed is one way to try and increase measurability. Keeping a contribution log focused on a certain skill set such as coding or design could help with making it easier to compare and understand how different contributors have executed certain outcomes versus other contributors. The challenge with trying to make the execution scope more measurable is that each idea being executed is usually different from other ideas and thus can require different skills and expertise to execute them. Executing these different ideas can also produce very different outcomes. Infrastructure and protocol development for instance could have a lot of variation in how the different problems are solved and what skills are required when developing the code.



**Time**

Contribution outcomes could be recorded within a certain time period so that there is more consistency in the amount of work that is being completed within each contribution log. This helps to increase measurability as now individuals can be more easily compared based on the same duration of contribution time.



**Number of people**

If the contribution outcomes come from multiple people and are being combined into the same contribution log this would make it more difficult to understand who did what and how performant and impactful each of their contributions were. Keeping contribution outcomes recorded separately as individual contributions can help with making it easier to measure the differences between one person's contribution outputs with other contributors.



## **Individual monthly contribution logs**

Recording one person's contribution efforts at a time and recording contributions within a fixed time period, such as monthly, are the two stand out approaches mentioned above that could consistently help with making contribution efforts more measurable. In terms of execution scope, it is more difficult to separate out every type of contribution effort into separate submissions. However the execution scope could at least be improved by tagging the skills that are being used when recording these contribution efforts. For instance, design and code contributions could be recorded and tagged separately to make it clearer about what different skill sets have been used.

## **Individual contribution measurement is often unavoidable**

Many ideas such as applications, protocols, community efforts and many other initiatives can often require a number of different contributors to help with executing those ideas. All of these initiatives will need to fairly determine how the people involved in executing that idea should be paid for their contribution efforts.

If contribution efforts are not measured in any capacity it will be difficult to know who has done what work and who has done the most work overall. It would be difficult to know who has performed the most effectively when executing the idea and who has made the most impactful contributions. This outcome is problematic as this could mean hard working and high performing contributors aren’t correctly rewarded for their effort. These actors could simply decide to not work with this group of contributors in the future due to this or could alternatively just not work as hard as their efforts weren’t recognised. Not monitoring or recording contribution efforts could also mean it becomes more difficult to spot which contributors are not performing well and not contributing as effectively as they could be.

When contribution efforts are not recorded the process of verifying and measuring peoples contribution efforts can end up being pushed towards certain individuals in the group such as project owners. This outcome gives those individuals more power and influence over what each individual will be compensated. Alternatively, if the decision process for what people get paid was democratic then the main issue with a lack of recorded contribution efforts is that people would need to be much more aware of what everyone has been working on to make an informed decision on what is fair and reasonable.

Recording contribution efforts improves both of these scenarios. If a small group of individuals have more influence over how much contributors get paid the contribution logs would provide more evidence to fairly determine the value of peoples contribution efforts. The contributors would have a more reliable way to prove their value. In a democratic decision process for distributing compensation the contributors would all benefit from having more access to accurate contribution logs that showcase what each of them have been working on. Understanding how people have contributed towards an idea can become a foundational source of information to make informed decisions about who has been the most performant and effective in the team.

Recorded contribution efforts can help with improving future decisions about how compensation is distributed based on each individual's performance and the impact they made. Improving the accuracy and measurability of the contribution logs can help with better aligning the incentives to reward the individuals that have been the most hard working and performant. Making it easier to record, verify and present these contribution logs can make it easier to reward contributors based on the merits of their contribution outcomes rather than this process being a popularity contest or biassed to certain individuals over others.
