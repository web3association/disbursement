# Contribution measurement

Making contribution logs more measurable can help to improve their usefulness and value. Increased measurability means it becomes easier to compare contribution logs between different contributors and make historical comparisons to see who has been the most performant and whether individuals and groups of contributors are getting more performant or not over time. Higher measurability can increase the accuracy in identifying the top performers who can then be rewarded for that performance and impact they generate.



## **Contribution recording approaches**



**Automatically recorded contributions**

Some contribution efforts can be recorded automatically and provide evidence of what a contributor has been working on. Many digital based contributions can be quantifiable and verifiable such as code contributions, designs, articles, blogs and documentation changes. Online recorded meetings could even be eventually automatically transcribed and verified to prove someone's attendance and contributions towards a discussion.



**Manually recorded contributions**

It could be challenging to make automatic recordings for every single contribution someone makes. In person events, meetings or other forms of mentorship and leadership could be more difficult to record without adding a manual submission that covers the contribution effort. Contributions that are added manually by a contributor or community member can benefit from having attestations attached to those claims. Other community members could vouch for the contributions made by others. This can be a useful approach to cover the types of contributions that exist which are harder to verify. The identities of the community members giving these attestations would need to be verified and trusted for these attestations to become more reliable.



**Observationally recorded contributions**

Contributors that work with other contributors are able to observe some of the contribution outcomes and impact that other contributors generate. Companies may often use this approach where they don’t actively record the contribution efforts of each individual and instead a manager is observing the efforts and outcomes that people are generating over time. The problem with this approach is if the person doing the observations is given too much of the control to do all of the performance and impact measurement they are given a large amount of influence and power over determining peoples value and compensation. If contribution efforts can be logged and owned by the individual who made them there is higher usability of that information for the contributor as they can now more easily prove their competencies and value to others. More trust is needed in management when using an observational approach to monitor and verify contribution efforts.



### **Measuring recorded contributions**

All the contribution recording approaches mentioned above could be used for recording someone's contribution efforts. Automatically recorded contribution outcomes are the most desirable approach for capturing contribution information as it can provide the strongest evidence about what a contributor has actually worked on. Automatic contribution records can help with removing the risks around incorrect or exaggerated efforts that are manually being recorded. Automated contribution records can also reduce or even remove the time needed for a contributor to record their contribution efforts. Manually recorded contributions are an important addition to automatically recorded contributions as they can fill in the gaps for areas that are not as easy to automatically record. Manually recorded contributions can help with providing the full information about someone's contributions. Processes are needed that have the right checks and balances in place and the right incentive design to make sure these self recorded contributions get verified. There will always be a risk that someone tries to game this system in an attempt to unfairly improve their own reputation and future chance of receiving funding. Making it easier for individuals to record their contribution efforts can create an opportunity to reduce any ambiguity about how much contribution effort someone has made and how performant and impactful their contribution outcomes have been for an ecosystem. More tools and processes will be needed to effectively record and verify the contribution efforts someone has made. Contributors could greatly benefit from building up a history of contribution logs as it can help to give them more control and ownership over their reputation by making it easier for them to demonstrate their experience and competencies through their contributions.



## **Steps for recording individual contributions**



**1. Automatically recorded contributions**

Automatically recorded contributions are a great foundation for creating contribution logs. Digital contributions such as code commits, designs and written submissions can be automatically tracked and tied to the account holder who made those contributions. Digital contributions such as these can be recorded and verified more easily. Automatically recorded contribution logs alone could be very insightful for understanding what each contributor has been working on.



**2. Manually recorded contributions**

Any contributions that are not automatically recorded and verified could be added onto a contribution log as a manual submission. Manual contributions could include in person event attendance, collaboration efforts or research efforts that didn’t produce a digitally recorded outcome that can be more easily verified. These contributions could be self reported and verified where possible. If contribution efforts cannot be verified the weighting in terms of the usefulness and reliability of this submission would naturally be lower.



**3. Peer to peer attestations**

Contributors often work with other contributors when they help with executing different ideas. These contributors can create attestations about other people's contribution efforts. These attestations could create a more clearer image on how contributors have been working together and how each person's contributions have impacted others. Peer to peer attestations can add more clarity and evidence around the relevance and impact of different peoples contribution efforts. Peer to peer attestations do have the risk of people trying to game this system to try and financially benefit themselves by lying about what they have worked on and trying to get fraudulent attestations from others. Checks and balances will be needed to help mitigate this risk.



**4. Peer review**

Individuals that don’t actively work with some of the contributors in the ecosystem could still have relevant expertise and experience that might be useful for reviewing the contributions that others have made in the ecosystem. Peer review of the contribution efforts made by other groups and individuals can help to highlight opportunities for improvements, new ideas and help with identifying bad actors who could be trying to abuse the system in some way. Peer review could also be done over a longer time period to review what impact has been generated by different contributors over time. Impact could be generated slowly over time and it might not be obvious how an executed idea will make an impact across the ecosystem. A peer review process could explore the impact that these contributions have made over different time periods. Peer review of other people's contribution efforts could be an effective way to improve the accuracy in identifying the top performers and ensuring that they are fairly compensated for their performance and impact that they have generated for the ecosystem.



## **Contribution measurability complexities**



**Short vs long term outcomes**

The value and impact generated by contribution efforts are not always obvious. Some contributions can have longer term implications that benefit an ecosystem over time.



**Wide impact potential**

Contribution efforts could help with producing a variety of different outcomes that each could make an impact in a number of ways. Contribution efforts could impact an ecosystem's functionality, usability and experience or they could impact the wider community in how they think and potentially influence their preferences and how they behave. It will be difficult to predict what positive impact someone's contributions will have on a wider ecosystem.



**Contribution variability**

A contributor could make a wide variety of different contributions to generate impact for an ecosystem. Each of these different types of contribution effort could require different approaches for those efforts to be recorded, measured and verified.



**Leadership based contributions**

Some contribution efforts could be focussed on inspiring and aligning the efforts of a group of contributors. These types of contributions can be more difficult to assess the value of these efforts due to the fact that each individual could respond differently to these leadership efforts.



**Social based contributions**

How contributors interact with one another on a social level can have a big impact on the team's rapport and the cohesion and alignment between a group of contributors. Positive contributions to social environments are harder to record and verify accurately yet these contributions could be highly valuable to an ecosystem by making a more welcoming and enjoyable place for people to collaborate and solve complex problems.



**Peer to peer measurement & verification**

Self-reported manual contributions and group based social and leadership contributions are all example contribution areas that can benefit from peer to peer attestations to determine what happened in a group working environment and what impact was generated by different peoples contribution efforts. There is a complexity in ensuring that these attestations are legitimate and not purposefully incorrect or biassed in an attempt to exploit a system to financially benefit a certain group of individuals.



## **Advantages of measurable contribution efforts**



**Easier contribution verification**

Logging an individual's contribution efforts makes it easier to verify that a given individual is actually making sufficient contribution effort towards executing different ideas. If contribution outcomes are recorded every month this can make it easier to compare those outcomes with other contributors. The more measurable the outcomes are the easier it will be to identify the weakest performers and the top performers. Support could be provided to contributors that need to improve their performance. If the performance of a contributor doesn’t improve or the individual is purposefully being a bad actor then it would be unlikely that they receive future funding due to the evidence of poor performance shown in their contribution logs.



**Improved decision making**

Measurable contribution logs can help with making it easier for voters to spot the best and worst performers amongst a group of contributors. It can also help with identifying trends in the performance of contributors as a whole or where certain skill sets are missing. This information can help with improving future disbursement decisions about where to allocate more resources and focus.



**Higher self awareness & accountability**

If contributors can easily see their own performance against other contributors they are able to become more aware and self accountable for trying to achieve a similar or higher level of contribution output as the other contributors in the ecosystem.



**Empowers individual contributors**

Being able to demonstrate impactful contribution outcomes is empowering for building a contributors reputation. Competent and high performing contributors that are able to easily demonstrate their capabilities and performance should be able to more easily receive fair compensation for their efforts. Rewarding contributors who are working harder or more effectively than others is an important way that the available incentives can be more effectively aligned with generating impact for the ecosystem. Another way that evidence of contribution outcomes helps to empower the individual is that it provides a public facing record that demonstrates what a contributor has achieved and what skill sets they are competent at. This can make it easier for different teams and projects to verify that a contributor is well suited to help them with their own execution efforts. The easier it is for an individual to prove their ability and competencies the more control and influence they will have on being able to pick the most suitable initiatives for them to work on and help with ensuring that they will get paid fairly for their skill and competency level.
