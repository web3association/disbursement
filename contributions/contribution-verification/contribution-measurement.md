# Contribution measurement

Making contribution logs more measurable can help to improve their usefulness and value. Increased measurability means it becomes easier to compare contribution logs between different contributors and make historical comparisons to see who has been the most performant and whether individuals and groups of contributors are getting more performant or not over time. Higher measurability can increase the accuracy in identifying the top performers who can then be rewarded for that performance and impact they generate.



## **Contribution effort recording approaches**

**Observationally recorded contributions**

Leadership and management or other contributors that work with a contributor are able to observe some of the contribution efforts and outcomes that a contributor is responsible for. Companies may often use an observational approach as a simple way to monitor what contribution efforts each person is making and how performant those people are. They might not actively record the contribution efforts of each individual and instead a manager is instead observing the efforts and outcomes that people are generating over time. The problem with this approach is if the person doing the observations is given a lot of control to do all of the performance and impact measurement they are given a large amount of influence and power over determining other peoples value and compensation. Observationally recorded contributions rely on people to make the observations which means this is the most time consuming approach to verify and review someones contribution efforts.

**Manually recorded contributions**

Contributors can manually make a submission about the contribution efforts they are making and provide the evidence to support that claim. Some contribution efforts are not easy to automatically record and verify. In person events, meetings or other forms of mentorship and leadership could be more difficult to record without using a manual submission process to capture these contribution efforts. Contributions that are added manually by a contributor or other community member could benefit from having attestations attached to those claims. Other community members could vouch for the contributions made by others. This can be a useful addition to manually recorded contribution efforts to make it easier to verify that a contributor has done what they say they did. Peer to peer attestations does have the risks that this process is abused by malicious actors. The identities of the community members giving these attestations would ideally need to be verified and trusted for these attestations to become more reliable.

**Automatically recorded contributions**

A number of contribution efforts can be recorded automatically and provide evidence about what a contributor has been working on. Digital based contributions can often be easily recorded and be verifiable. Examples include code contributions, designs, articles, blogs and documentation changes. Online recorded meetings could even be eventually automatically transcribed and verified to prove someone's attendance and contributions towards a discussion. Automatically recorded contributions can be highly useful for contributors by making it more effortless to record and verify the contributions that they have made.



## Preference for automatically recorded contributions

All the contribution recording approaches mentioned above could be used in combination for recording someone's contribution efforts. Automatically recorded contribution outcomes are the most desirable approach for capturing contribution information as it can provide the fastest and most easily verifiable evidence about what a contributor has actually worked on. Automatically recorded contributions can help with removing the risks around incorrect or exaggerated efforts that could have been manually recorded. Automatic contribution records can also reduce or even remove the time needed for a contributor to record their contribution efforts. Manually recorded contributions are the next important addition to automatically recorded contributions as they can fill in the gaps for areas that are not as easy to automatically record. Manually recorded contributions can help with providing the full information about someone's contributions. Processes will be needed that have the right checks and balances in place along with the right incentive design to make sure these self recorded contributions get verified. There will always be a risk that someone tries to game this system in an attempt to unfairly improve their own reputation and future chance of receiving funding. Making it easier for individuals to record their contribution efforts helps to create an opportunity to reduce ambiguity about how much contribution effort someone has made and how performant and impactful their contribution efforts have been for an ecosystem. Observationally verified contribution efforts are the most time consuming approach. This approach can also be more easily abused if certain individuals are given more influence over deciding other peoples compensation. There could likely always be an element of observational verification needed to review peoples contribution efforts as there is often always an incentive for a contributor to try and abuse any adopted system for self gain.



## **Contribution measurability complexities**



**Short vs long term outcomes**

The value and impact generated by contribution efforts are not always obvious. Some contributions can have longer term implications that benefit an ecosystem over time.



**Wide impact potential**

Contribution efforts could help with producing a variety of different outcomes that each could make an impact in a number of ways. Contribution efforts could impact an ecosystem's functionality, usability and experience or they could impact the wider community in how they think and potentially influence their preferences and how they behave. It will be difficult to predict what positive impact someone's contributions will have on a wider ecosystem.



**Contribution variability**

A contributor could make a wide variety of different contributions to generate impact for an ecosystem. Each of these different types of contribution effort could require different approaches for those efforts to be recorded, measured and verified.



**Leadership based contributions**

Some contribution efforts could be focussed on inspiring and aligning the efforts of a group of contributors. These types of contributions can be more difficult to assess the value of these efforts due to the fact that each individual could respond differently to these leadership efforts.



**Social based contributions**

How contributors interact with one another on a social level can have a big impact on the team's rapport and the cohesion and alignment between a group of contributors. Positive contributions to social environments are harder to record and verify accurately yet these contributions could be highly valuable to an ecosystem by making a more welcoming and enjoyable place for people to collaborate and solve complex problems.



**Peer to peer measurement & verification**

Self-reported manual contributions and group based social and leadership contributions are all example contribution areas that can benefit from peer to peer attestations to determine what happened in a group working environment and what impact was generated by different peoples contribution efforts. There is a complexity in ensuring that these attestations are legitimate and not purposefully incorrect or biassed in an attempt to exploit a system to financially benefit a certain group of individuals.



## **Advantages of measurable contribution efforts**



**Easier contribution verification**

Logging an individual's contribution efforts makes it easier to verify that a given individual is actually making sufficient contribution effort towards executing different ideas. If contribution outcomes are recorded every month this can make it easier to compare those outcomes with other contributors. The more measurable the outcomes are the easier it will be to identify the weakest performers and the top performers. Support could be provided to contributors that need to improve their performance. If the performance of a contributor doesnâ€™t improve or the individual is purposefully being a bad actor then it would be unlikely that they receive future funding due to the evidence of poor performance shown in their contribution logs.



**Improved decision making**

Measurable contribution logs can help with making it easier for voters to spot the best and worst performers amongst a group of contributors. It can also help with identifying trends in the performance of contributors as a whole or where certain skill sets are missing. This information can help with improving future disbursement decisions about where to allocate more resources and focus.



**Higher self awareness & accountability**

If contributors can easily see their own performance against other contributors they are able to become more aware and self accountable for trying to achieve a similar or higher level of contribution output as the other contributors in the ecosystem.



**Empowers individual contributors**

Being able to demonstrate impactful contribution outcomes is empowering for building a contributors reputation. Competent and high performing contributors that are able to easily demonstrate their capabilities and performance should be able to more easily receive fair compensation for their efforts. Rewarding contributors who are working harder or more effectively than others is an important way that the available incentives can be more effectively aligned with generating impact for the ecosystem. Another way that evidence of contribution outcomes helps to empower the individual is that it provides a public facing record that demonstrates what a contributor has achieved and what skill sets they are competent at. This can make it easier for different teams and projects to verify that a contributor is well suited to help them with their own execution efforts. The easier it is for an individual to prove their ability and competencies the more control and influence they will have on being able to pick the most suitable initiatives for them to work on and help with ensuring that they will get paid fairly for their skill and competency level.
