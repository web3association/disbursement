## Applicable disbursement approaches

Any approach that adopts an independently operated priority process will need to think about how that process is incentivised. The applicable disbursement approaches include:

* Idea & contributor combined process
* Independent processes
* Passive idea selection process
* Delegated idea selection process

The fully combined process is not applicable for this analysis as the incentives for priorities would be handled inside proposals that include the execution part of the process.



## Priority submission process

Incentives could be used to help with encouraging people to submit priorities that highlight what opportunities or problems exist in the ecosystem. Part of this incentive could help with encouraging proposers to add any existing information that provides evidence towards why a priority is actually important. An incentive could be used to reward voters for participating in the selection of important priorities for the ecosystem.



**Desirable outcomes**

* **Diversity of thought** - The priority process can benefit from attracting a diversity of thought from the community about which problems and opportunities exist. This diversity shown across the priorities submitted can help with enabling the voters with thinking about which priorities are the most important at that moment. Enabling a full range of opinions in the priority process will help with creating a more expressive system that effectively represents the opinions of the wider community.
* **Quality submissions** - Adding the right depth of thought along with all of the relevant supporting information sources will be an important part of creating insightful and relevant priorities for a community to consider. Incentives should ideally help with increasing the quality of the priorities being submitted so that the suggestions are well justified.
* **Inclusive** - A prioritisation process can help with enabling and expressing the thoughts and opinions of the community. Being more inclusive will mean making the process simple to use and participate in and that any incentives involved help to better enable a wider diversity of people to contribute to the process.
* **Timely submissions** - If an ecosystem wants to be more responsive to a fast changing environment it will benefit from ensuring priority proposals can be submitted at any time. Incentives could potentially be used to encourage a faster speed of submission for emerging problems and opportunities.
* **Priorities are addressable** - Priorities that get submitted and then selected should ideally be addressable. This means that there are feasible ideas to execute that would actually address the priority and the priority is measurable in someway to determine when the priority has actually been addressed. If the priority was not measurable it could use a voting mechanism for the community to indicate that they believe a priority has been addressed. Alternatively this could also be a more naturally occurring event where other priorities get increasingly selected and become more important than ones that are becoming increasingly addressed over time.



**Concerns**

* **Lack of engagement** - Suggesting and deciding on the priorities for an ecosystem provides an effective path for community members to express themselves and what they believe needs to happen over the coming months and years to better support and improve the ecosystem. A process for priority setting that takes too long or that is too complex could be a reason for a lack of engagement. Another reason is if existing priorities are not getting addressed people may choose to disengage with the priority process.
* **Process complexity** - The priority process will be an important part of disbursement for community members to participate in so that their thoughts can be heard. The diversity and depth of different opinions could easily lead to the creation of an overly complex process to submit priorities and improve any existing ones. Considerations will be needed for how incentives could help to encourage the submission of priorities that remain relevant and concise but still highly informative.
* **Information complexity** - The diversity of opinions and information relevant to priorities could be vast and potentially highly overlapping. A priority system will need to consider how it manages and incentivises more collaboration around similar opinions rather than outcomes that lead to a lot of duplicated information. It will also be important to incentivise people to add the most relevant and concise pieces of information to a priority rather than to add as many pieces of information as possible.
* **Biased contributions** - An ongoing concern with the submission of priorities will be who is submitting the priority suggestion and whether that submission is highly aligned with supporting their own financial interests or not. Priorities aligning with someones financial interests is not necessarily an issue by itself however this is something the community would need to be aware of so they can take this into account when voting on different priorities.



**Potential proposal submission incentive approaches**

* **Selection incentive** - A selection incentive could be effective for encouraging a diversity of contribution and compensating wider participation. Communities will benefit from a priority process that enables them to most effectively express what they believe are the biggest problems and opportunities in the ecosystem. Providing some form of compensation when a priority is selected can help with increasing the range of potential community members that are willing and capable of participating in that process now that there contribution time is compensated.
* **No incentive** - There is already a natural incentive for community member to express their opinions when they believe there are problems or opportunities that should be addressed. One reason that a no incentive approach may work is that the submission of priorities does not need to be a complex process. There could be ongoing maintenance of the information attached to a priority but this incentive does not need to be handled at the submission stage. Another reason a no incentive approach may be suitable is because the complexity of the average priority could be relatively low for some ecosystems that are smaller or focussed on a more narrow set of longer term goals. An ecosystem could also choose to adopt a no incentive approach to see how many people participate in the priority process and how it gets used over time as the ecosystem evolves and scales. The more complex an ecosystem and prioritisation becomes the more important it will be a treasury to consider how incentives could help compensate the increasing amount of contribution effort required for people to participate in the priority process.



## **Priority information maintenance**

Priorities will often change over time as new information or changing factors and environments influence the current progress and importance of the existing priorities. Incentives can help with handling how priorities get maintained over time after they are submitted and selected through voting. Incentives could help with encouraging people to provide feedback and discussion around any of the existing priorities. Feedback could mean providing supporting or counter arguments to the points made in an existing priority. This feedback could also include further supporting information to better justify their feedback. Keeping priorities and any related information up to date will be an important part of keeping the voters informed on the progress and changing importance of existing priorities. The more accurate and reliable prioritisation is the more accurate an ecosystem can become in allocating treasury resources towards initiatives that address the most important priorities.



**Desirable outcomes**

* **Well maintained information** - Keeping priorities up to date with the most relevant and important information will help with keeping the community well informed about what is happening for each priority.
* **Timely updates** - Incentivising quicker contributions to add new information to existing priorities could be an effective way to make a community more responsive to a fast changing environment where certain priorities could become more or less important over time.
* **Improved decision making** - New information being added to existing priorities could help with making voters more well informed and influence future decisions on where treasury assets should be allocated.
* **Reallocation of contribution effort** - Updating priorities can help with the reallocation of contribution efforts from one priority to another as the importance of each priority changes over time.



**Concerns**

* **Information complexity** - Some priorities could have a large amount of different information that is relevant and useful for understanding the current progress and importance of the priority. The ongoing complexity with maintaining a priority is ensuring that only relevant information gets added so that the amount of information involved in a priority does not become too overwhelming. Too much information could make it difficult for voters to easily and quickly understand what is happening with each priority and which priorities are currently the most important.
* **Biased contributions** - An ongoing concern with the maintenance of priorities will be who is attaching more information and updates to an existing priority. Priorities can highly influence where treasury assets get allocated meaning there would be an incentive to influence that process in a way that benefits the contributor.



**Potential execution incentive approaches**

* **Time incentives** - Paying contributors to maintain and update priorities over time could be a simple and effective way to keep priority information up to date. Full time based compensation for this work could be an effective approach for this responsibility as the contributors involved in supporting the priority process would have the capacity to consider how any new information relates to any of the existing priorities. Contributors would have more capacity to ensure only relevant information is attached to existing priorities which is important as otherwise priorities would become difficult to read and digest if too much information was added. This incentive approach could also help with moderating priorities that get submitted by community members to ensure they meet certain quality thresholds if this was deemed necessary.
* **Performance incentives** - If contributors were very actively involved in maintaining a priority process they would likely become much more informed of the different pieces of information that are emerging and flowing through the ecosystem. The better that these contributors are able to identify and understand this diversity of information the more effectively they should be able to highlight and apply that information to any of the existing priorities. Rewarding contributors who most effectively contribute towards achieving these outcomes could be an effective way to align the incentives for contributors to become increasingly well informed when contributing to the prioritisation process so that they become increasingly likely to receive compensation for their contributions.
* **Task incentives** - Contributors could be rewarded for every time they suggest additions or changes to the information that is attached to an existing priority. The benefit of this type of approach is it would add a simple incentive for contributors to keep a priority up to date with new information and could help to distribute that incentive amongst many different contributors. The main concern with this approach is that priorities can benefit from having the most highly relevant and concise information being added to inform the community on what is happening for each priority. This is instead of adding every piece of information that might be somewhat relevant but result in bloating the priority process. A task incentive could increase the risk that many contributors suggest many different pieces of information just to receive the compensation, rather than being very deliberate and considerate when suggesting information.
* **No incentives** - If the priorities being submitted are less complex and don’t need updating over time with new information then adopting a approach of no incentives could be a suitable option for some ecosystems. If priorities do benefit from being updated with recent information that would be a risk that voters would be less well informed when making decisions and result in more suboptimal outcomes in future treasury disbursement events.



## Priority execution

When priorities get selected by a community the next step is for those priorities to be addressed through the execution of suitable ideas. Incentives that help with addressing existing priorities could be attached to the priority process itself or these incentives could also be handled elsewhere such as in the idea or execution processes for disbursement.



**Desirable outcomes**

* **Important priorities get addressed** - Regardless of whether the incentives to address priorities are attached or not to the priority process themselves a key outcome for the priority process will be that any incentives that are adopted will help to support any efforts to address important priorities over time.
* **Measurable outcomes** - Although it might not always be easy or possible, it is desirable for priorities to be measurable so that the progress and completion of any priorities can be more easily tracked and understood.



**Concerns**

* **Measuring priority completion** - Priorities that are larger or more complex can be more difficult for making them measurable. Priorities that are difficult to measure and be marked as complete could make it more difficult to attach incentives to priority process itself for the execution of priorities.
* **Execution scope complexity** - Larger priorities can involve a variety of different ideas of different complexities to help with addressing a single priority. The more scope there is for the execution of different ideas the harder it would become to allocate budgets to the execution of a priority instead of the ideas or contributors executing those ideas.
* **Changing priority complexity** - If the scope of a priority changed over time due to new information or a changing environment the amount of incentives that are available and required to address that priority might change. This could make more difficult to attach accurate budgets in the priority process itself as the scope and requirements of the priority expand and contract suddenly or over time.
* **Stifling other forms of innovation** - An issue of attaching incentives to the priority process is that not every impactful idea and area of contribution needs to come from a priority that has been selected by voters. Innovation can come from people going against the general consensus and thought process of the crowd. If incentives are too closely attached to the priorities being selected then there is a risk of having too much group think and stifling certain areas of potential innovation.



**Potential execution incentive approaches**

* **No incentives** - The incentive for handling the execution of priorities could be handled through attaching the incentives to the execution of ideas or the contribution efforts made during execution. This approach is simple and could make sense for many ecosystems as addressing priorities can often require the execution of numerous ideas. Each idea and any contributors involved would then justify their costs more exactly. Under this approach the ecosystem would vote on the ideas or contributors that should be incentivised to execute different initiatives that help with addressing the existing priorities. If there are many different ideas that are tackling the same priority a ecosystem will be able to show increasing support of dissent over time depending on the progress and impact made by each of these ideas are they start to make more progress. Not applying incentives in the priority process helps to keep the process simple whilst still enabling the community to express which problems and opportunities are the most important.
* **Impact incentives** - Priorities could have compensation rewarded to contributors that have helped to address an existing priority. This could help align contributors with longer term contribution efforts to ensure that important priorities get fully addressed. This incentive approach would require some mechanism for voters to accept that a priority has been addressed or for the priority to be measurable in someway so that it can be more easily determined on whether it has been addressed or not.
* **Time incentives** - People could be paid to contribute towards addressing priorities directly. This could make more sense if the scope of the priority was more limited and there wasn’t a need for numerous different ideas to be executed to address each priority. The more important and complex the priorities become the more suitable it might be for the incentives to be attached to the ideas or contributors involved in execution.
* **Milestones incentives -** Some priorities could be turned into milestones of execution so that it becomes clearer on how far a long the progress is on a given priority. It could add complexity to the process if some priorities did this and others didn’t but it also might be difficult to break every priority down into different milestone phases. One way this could be approached is having priority levels such as a high level priority that is a wider priority and then goals within that priority that map to milestones or certain stages of achievement in addressing the main priority. Breaking a priority into milestones would not necessarily change the fact that there could be many ideas and different solutions that help with addressing the priority. This could mean it still makes sense to move the incentive for addressing the priority to the idea or contributor selection processes for disbursement.
* **Performance incentives** - If certain priorities get addressed faster than others due to the effectiveness of the contributors involved in executing different ideas there could be compensation that is rewarded for their speed of execution. This incentive could also be handled in the idea or execution processes themselves though which might be more suitable.
* **Task incentives** - Task incentives could be suitable for some priorities that are smaller and more easily measurable so that there the scope of contribution effort can be more accurately estimated so that the amount of compensation rewarded is more accurate. The more complex a task is the more risk there is of under or over compensating someone due to discrepancies in how long it actually took to execute a piece of work.
