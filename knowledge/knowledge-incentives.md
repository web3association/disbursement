# Knowledge incentives

![](../.gitbook/assets/knowledge-incentives.png)



The creation of new knowledge can be handed with the same disbursement process that is used to fund other initiatives that help with generating impact for an ecosystem. An ecosystem could choose to have a separate disbursement process that is just for knowledge creation if this was preferred.

Voters need to have access to and be able to digest any available knowledge prior to making any disbursement decisions if they want to be as well informed as possible when making those decisions. Voters will also benefit from new knowledge being created or existing knowledge being improved to help with future decisions.

There is already a natural incentive for people who have any ownership or usage of an ecosystem through coins or tokens to become more informed about what is happening in the ecosystem. Knowledge can help voters to improve an ecosystem using their vote and make it easier to find solutions and services that they were previously not aware of that could also offer them value.

Creating or updating knowledge sources can be time consuming for the contributors involved and the outcomes of this work could become highly influential for future disbursement decisions. Getting the incentives right for creating and maintaining knowledge will mean that the knowledge that gets created is up to date, relevant and accurate. Knowledge could cover areas about the ecosystem, other competing ecosystems or many other relevant topic areas.



**Desirable outcomes**

* **Accuracy** - The accuracy of any knowledge created will be a vital outcome for any contribution efforts that bring new knowledge to an ecosystem. Any knowledge created could be used by voters to make priority, idea or contributor selection decisions. Due to this the accuracy and correctness of any knowledge produced will need to be high. Incentives can help by focussing on the quality of knowledge produced instead of the quantity.
* **Information quality** - Higher information quality will mean that all of the relevant areas of information are covered when a new piece of knowledge is created. As an example a transaction explorer would benefit from including all of the information about transactions so that it’s very clear what is happening instead of only a subset of that transaction information. The knowledge created should ideally provide full coverage of the relevant information.
* **Verifiable** - Many knowledge sources can come from systems and processes that provide factual data about what happened during execution. Making it possible for knowledge sources to be verifiable will increase the amount of trust people can place in this knowledge created.
* **Maintained information** - Knowledge can quickly become out of date if it is not updated over time. Incentives can play an important part in ensuring that important knowledge sources are kept up to date so they remain relevant and highly useful. Incentives that are ongoing instead of just one off incentives could be one approach to help with maintaining existing knowledge sources over time.
* **Timeliness of new information** - Knowledge can impact any part of the disbursement process so having access to useful information as quickly as possible can make a big difference in how effectively assets get disbursed and how fast existing contributors can respond to new information. Incentives that help with encouraging the ongoing creation of insightful knowledge could be highly beneficial to an ecosystems ability to be responsive to changes and when making any future decisions. One way in which the timeliness for getting access to knowledge could be improved is supporting knowledge source that can be automated through software.
* **Automated systems** - Knowledge that can come from automated systems can provide live an readily available information as soon as it’s available. Opportunities to create any automated systems that gather, analyse and present data can be highly beneficial for voters to use when making there own disbursement decisions. These systems can also be foundational for deeper analysis that looks to identify important problems or opportunities. Incentives could be used to better identify and further support systems that can be automated to gather and analyse vital information for an ecosystem.
* **Diversity of information sources** - Quality information that is useful for making well informed decisions can come from a multitude of sources. Using sources of knowledge that come from both inside and outside the ecosystem can be highly beneficial for making an ecosystem more well informed.



**Concerns**

* **Relevance** - The true value of some areas of information may not be immediately obvious when deciding whether to support a knowledge initiative or not. Sometimes it is the intersections of multiple pieces of information that help bring more clarity, new understandings or that help with identifying certain problems and opportunities that exist.
* **Information complexity** - Knowledge relevant to an ecosystem can cover a wide range of topics with different levels of complexity. Part of the challenge for incentivising the creation and maintenance of knowledge is ensuring that the outcomes of that work are not overly complex for others to digest and understand. Readability and usability of knowledge could be increased through incentives that reward contributors for the ease of use of the new knowledge they helped to create.
* **Conciseness** - The larger the amount of knowledge available the longer it will take for voters to become well informed on the range of knowledge that exists. Incentives for creating and maintaining knowledge will benefit from ensuring that the most important knowledge is clear and concise as it can become increasingly difficult to expect voters to digest vast amounts of information. The conciseness of knowledge will be an important factor for the scalability of participation in disbursement processes and governance more generally.



**Potential incentive approaches**

The process of incentivising new knowledge can go through the same idea and execution approaches as already covered. This means new knowledge systems or one of pieces of knowledge could be selected by voters through the different disbursement approaches that have been already covered. The idea incentives and execution incentives pieces of analysis help to cover the types of incentives that could be used to create new knowledge.
