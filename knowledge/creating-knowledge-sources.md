# Creating knowledge sources

Knowledge plays a vital part in making well informed disbursement decisions. An amount of knowledge will be available to an ecosystems community at the point in which disbursement decisions are made. The more that useful knowledge is available and the more that it is accurate and relevant the easier it should become for voters to make more optimal disbursement decisions.

Creating or improving new knowledge sources can be an effective way to make decision making more well informed. An ecosystem will want to consider how it finds, creates and improves its knowledge sources so that it can improve the voters decision making ability.

Knowledge could come from one off pieces of research and analysis but also could come in the form of automated systems that gathers and analyse different areas of information. A transaction explorer is a good example of an automated knowledge system that would provide information about a distributed ledgers transactions that have been processed. This type of system can be insightful for determining how a distributed ledger is actually being used.



Useful knowledge could come from many different sources:

* **Treasury operation** - The operation of the treasury itself will produce data and insights in how the treasury and ecosystem is performing, such as how effective it’s own approaches are for increasing or maintaining income or whether the disbursement of assets is generating sufficiently impactful outcomes. The variety of different data points involved in operating the treasury could be highly useful for influencing future contribution efforts and identifying where certain improvements can be made to the operation of the treasury and to the wider ecosystem.
* **Treasury disbursement** - An ecosystems treasury disbursement can help with funding initiatives that improve the available knowledge that a community could use to stay well informed when making future disbursement or governance decisions.
* **Competing ecosystems** - The same information that is relevant to one ecosystem can also be relevant to another ecosystem as it provides further knowledge about what is and isn’t working across different ecosystems. Analysis could help with identifying the reasons why some ecosystems are performing better in certain areas than others which can then lead to better decision making by determining how an ecosystem could achieve a similar amount of success in those same areas.
* **Many external areas** - Any other source of information outside an ecosystem that is relevant such as market and economic data, adoption, usage and sentiment trends for different products & services, demographic data and any other relevant sources.



## Creating knowledge sources through treasury disbursement

The creation or improvement of knowledge could be achieved by funding different initiatives through the disbursement process. Those knowledge sources could help with improving the decision making ability of voters for future disbursement decisions.

The selection and funding of different pieces of knowledge could be achieved using the [disbursement decision approach](../disbursement-approaches/decision-approaches/) being used for disbursement.

Let’s take an example knowledge initiative that could seek funding from treasury disbursement. For this example initiative there is a developer that wants to create an automated transaction explorer that shows what is happening inside each transaction. At a higher level it will also show what is happening at a daily, weekly and monthly level so that the community can easily see how the ledger is actually being used and how that is changing over time. This knowledge source could be highly valuable for identifying where there might be inefficiencies or opportunities that exist in the ecosystem to work on certain areas. This knowledge source could help lead to identifying new priorities that then get addressed through the disbursement process!
