**Overview**

Attaching idea costs to contributor proposals means that contributors would need to account for any idea related costs when they are requesting their own compensation. This could be achieved by either just increasing their requested amount to include a buffer to handle these costs or it could be more exact by requesting the exact amount needed plus the compensation they are requesting.



**High idea cost budgeting complexity (Score - 2)**

The obvious problem with attaching idea costs to contributors is it is not suitable for the larger idea related costs such as real estate, production costs, office rent or lease payments or the larger software subscriptions or security service agreements. This approach would only truly work in situations where these types of larger shared costs are not accepted in the funding process and instead the ecosystem is focussed on compensating peoples contribution efforts. Some idea related costs could be suitable to attach to the contributors compensation requests when they are more relevant to the contributor such as smaller pieces of hardware or low cost insurance, software subscriptions, education & training and office supplies. Overall this approach can be fairly limiting in what types of idea costs it can easily handle.



**Very high idea cost change complexity (Score - 1)**

Without a separate process for handling idea costs the contributor wouldn’t be able to request further funds unless they could amend their original contributor compensation request. This would require approval and if they are only changing the idea related costs then this would start to look more like a separate idea costs process. Without this process a contributor would need to request for those funds in a future contributor funding process.



**Very low voter expressiveness (Score - 1)**

Voters would not easily be able to express their exact preferences about what idea costs should and shouldn’t be included unless this was handled separately.



**Total score = 4 / 15**
