**Overview**

Priority milestone incentives mean that a proposal would detail out the different tasks and steps involved in addressing a priority by executing different milestones. Each of those milestones would have to specify the amount of compensation that is required to execute each one. An amount of time could be specified against each of the execution tasks to achieve this total required compensation. Funds are released as each milestone gets executed where evidence will need to be submitted to prove that a milestone is complete. The milestones are strict in terms of the expected execution output that will occur for the compensation to be distributed. Any changes to the milestones would need to go through some form of approval process.



**Very high budgeting complexity (Score - 1)**

The budgeting complexity would inherit the same complexities as the idea milestone incentives approach. On top of this there is even increased complexity due to the following:

* **Budget planning complexity** - The larger the scope and budget is for addressing a priority the higher the complexity there is in budget planning due to the range of ideas that might be involved and the range and depth of the tasks that might need to be executed for those ideas. Large scope also increases the likelihood that something could happen during execution that changes the priority or the ideas being executed. This puts further difficulty in creating accurately budgeted milestones.
* **Execution scope risks** - Having proposals that could fund multiple ideas increases the potential scope and scale of the compensation being requested. The larger the scope of the idea the more risk there is that the execution efforts could take longer or shorter than expected due to a range of emerging factors during execution.



**Very high voter decision complexity (Score - 1)**

The voter decision complexity would inherit the same complexities as the idea milestone incentives approach. On top of this there is even increased complexity due to the following:

* **Ease of understanding** - Proposals that have multiple ideas would increase the complexity for the voter to fully understand whether those ideas can be executed within the stated milestone budgets. The larger the amount of scope the higher the complexity is for voters to fully understand whether the compensation duration and amount is fair and reasonable.
* **Ease of comparison** - Milestones across each proposal could be vastly different in scope and compensation for addressing different priorities. This makes it very difficult for voters to easily compare and determine if each of these proposals is fair and reasonable in their budgets without a sufficient level of understanding of each proposal individually.



**High governance complexity (Score - 2)**

The governance complexity would inherit the same complexities as the idea milestone incentives approach. On top of this there is even increased complexity due to the following:

* **Incentive distribution risks** - Larger proposal compensation requests increase the risks of the incentive being stolen or misused by the individual or multisig of contributors who are responsible for handling it.
* **Size of compensation risk** - Risks increase around how funds are used in any situation where larger amounts of compensation are handled by an individual or multiple people using a multi-sig. There would be a higher incentive to steal or misuse the funds for personal gain.
* **Community moderation complexity** - A larger scope and budget for addressing priorities means that contributor set priorities have more of a risk of being exaggerated or containing lies about how long a piece of work would actually take due to the amount of incentives involved. A larger amount of scope increases the moderation complexity to effectively determine if these suggested budgets are fair and reasonable.



**Very high game theory risks (Score - 1)**

The game theory risks would inherit the same risks as the idea milestone incentives approach. On top of this there is even increased risks due to the following:

* **Proposal details** - Addressing a priority can take a larger amount of execution effort which could result in requests for a larger amount of compensation in each proposal. The larger the scope and budget there is for a proposal the more risk there is that the estimated time it takes to execute something is exaggerated or purposefully incorrect. As milestones for each proposal are unique this becomes even harder to determine if the contributors are trying to game the system as they are able to self define the milestones.
* **Malicious voters** - The larger that the available incentive is the more reasons there are for malicious voters to try and influence the outcome of the disbursement decisions.
