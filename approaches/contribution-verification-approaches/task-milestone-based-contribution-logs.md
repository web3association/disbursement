**Overview**

Task milestone based contribution logs mean that a project has been broken down into milestones. Each milestone would have a set of tasks that need to be completed within that milestone. Contributors would submit evidence of any execution efforts when they have completed a milestone.



**Very low contribution measurability (Score - 1)**

The time taken to complete each milestone is different as it is defined by the contributors who are involved in the initiative. The amount of contributors involved in each milestone could be different. This approach is the least measurable and most difficult to compare with others as there is much higher variability in what can be submitted. A lot more work has to be done in isolation on a specific team's execution to work out whether they have in fact made fair and reasonable contribution efforts and whether they have been performant or not.



**Very low contribution log accuracy (Score - 1)**

Completed milestones can make it harder to understand exactly who has executed what outputs and exactly how long they spent on the tasks involved. Task milestones could include individual contribution information which would help to make it easier to compare individual performance. However this would also be the time periods involved in that execution. If both individual contributions and time periods are added then this ends up becoming an individual time based approach as well as a task milestone approach! Logs providing evidence for completion of task milestones by themselves do not provide much contribution accuracy.



**Very high game theory risks (Score - 1)**

Contributors can manipulate and exaggerate both the time it takes to complete any given task or the scope of what is being executed. Giving contributors the full ability to set the scope and time period maximises their ability to manipulate these inputs. The fact that each milestone will be different from the other milestones and with any of the other projects only increases this ability to manipulate these inputs in a way that would benefit the contributors. Maximising flexibility for this specific area in disbursement means maximising the difficulty for the community to determine what is fair and reasonable across all of the unique milestones that get submitted.



**Very low verification time required (Score - 3)**

Moderators would only need to verify the milestones of each project which could result in verification checks being needed less than once a month. This approach would likely require the least amount of verification time due to the infrequency of the milestone submissions. The average time required to verify submissions for any verification approach should also reduce over time as the tools and processes improve.



**Very low submission effort (Score - 3)**

Task based milestone contribution submissions need to confirm that a predefined milestone has been completed. All that is needed for a contribution log submission is the evidence showing that each task within a milestone has actually been completed.



**Total score = 9 / 21**
