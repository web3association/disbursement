# Disbursement approaches

A treasury may decide to disburse assets to fund initiatives that can help with addressing ecosystem priorities. A disbursement process could invite voters to help with selecting the most important priorities, ideas and contributors that could help with generating impactful outcomes.

Ecosystem knowledge will play an important part in the selection process for an ecosystems preferred priorities, ideas and contributors. Community members will select what information and knowledge they believe is most relevant when making their own informed disbursement decisions. In more complex disbursement processes there could be value in introducing another process before disbursement where community members share and vote on the pieces of analysis and information that they believe are the most relevant and important for the communities consideration in future disbursement decisions.



Deciding and voting on which are the most important and promising priorities, ideas and contributors could be achieved in a number. A selection of those approaches include:

* [**Fully combined process**](fully-combined-process.md) - The selection of priorities, ideas and contributors all happens in the same selection process.
* [**Idea & contributor combined process**](idea-and-contributor-combined-process.md) - The selection of priorities happens independently and then the selection of ideas and contributors happens in the same process.
* [**Independent processes**](independent-processes.md) - The selection of priorities, ideas and contributors happen all in separate processes.
* [**Passive idea selection process**](passive-idea-selection-process.md) - The selection of priorities, ideas and contributors happen all in separate processes, the voters only participate in idea selection when they believe this is necessary.
* [**Delegated idea selection process**](../disbursement-operating-process/delegating-disbursement-process-decisions.md) - The selection of priorities, ideas and contributors happen all in separate processes, the contributors are delegated the full responsibility of selecting the most promising ideas to execute.



To compare these approaches a number of [factors have been considered](factors-for-consideration.md) and then applied to each approach to better determine the strengths and weaknesses of each one.

The most expressive, flexible and least complex of the approaches outlined above were those that adopted independent processes for selecting the most impactful priorities, ideas and contributors. It is also worth noting that an ecosystem would be able to use any mixture of these mentioned approaches above. Different disbursement processes for different purposes may provide a better long term solution for each ecosystem.



## Prioritising certain disbursement outcomes

A key question to ask when adopting any of these different disbursement approaches is what types of outcomes are most important? What outcomes should the treasury disbursement process be optimising for? There could be many different outcomes that are important to each ecosystem, each of which those ecosystems may then want to quantify and optimise over time.



**Maximising decision involvement**

One potentially desirable outcome for an ecosystem could be that a treasury system maximises the involvement of voters in every disbursement decision. Achieving this outcome would mean the entire community will need to be able to vote on any part of the disbursement process and the systems and processes should help with actively encouraging voters to get involved in all available decisions. The independent processes approach could be one suitable way to achieve this type of outcome as voters would be encouraged to vote on everything and voters would also be able to vote on exactly what they want in each process without any compromise on their preferences. The reasons this property might not be desirable are that it might not be practical to try and expect or encourage voters to participate in every decision in the disbursement process. The larger the ecosystem is the harder this would be to achieve. This higher complexity at scale is a reason why approaches such as passive or delegated idea selection can be considered as alternatives.



**Maximising participation scalability**

Maximising the amount of participation in the disbursement process would mean making it easier and faster for voters to participate in the disbursement process. The easier and quicker it is for voters to participate in the disbursement process the more easy it will be for the disbursement process to scale the amount of participation to a larger audience. Optimising for this outcome will mean reducing the total time required and overall decision complexity as much as possible to achieve a higher amount of participation across a larger community. If this was the primary concern for a treasury system then considering the delegated idea selection approach could potentially be a suitable option. This reduces some of the required involvement from the voter and leans towards increasing the simplicity and speed of the disbursement decisions.



**Maximising both participation scalability and decision involvement**

Trying to get all community members to decide on every decision can be a difficult outcome when trying to scale the amount of participation to a larger audience. Time consuming disbursement decisions can easily lead to voter apathy and disengagement, a problem that can increase as an ecosystem tries to scale. One way an ecosystem could achieve a balance in achieving both these outcomes could be by adopting a passive idea selection process. Under this approach all voters could still participate in the different disbursement decisions however at a system and process level it is the priorities and contributor selection that are encouraged as the main decisions that should be made by the community. This then leaves the idea selection as optional, helping to reduce the complexity and time taken to participate which helps with increasing participation scalability whilst also allowing for full decision involvement.
