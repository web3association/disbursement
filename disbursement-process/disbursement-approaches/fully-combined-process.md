# Fully combined process

![](../../.gitbook/assets/fully-combined-process.png)



**Overview**

A fully combined decision is where voters will select the priorities, ideas and contributors in a single process. This means proposals in this type of process will contain one or multiple priorities, ideas and contributors that voters will then decide between.

**Very high voter participation complexity (Score - 1)**

For voters to participate they need to read, understand and compare all of the proposals with the priorities, ideas and contributors that are suggested. Voters must participate in the entire disbursement process with the entire decision making in a single vote. Voters are unable to partially participate in some of the disbursement process separately.



**High voter decision complexity (Score - 2)**

The voter must digest and understand the priorities, ideas and contributors being suggested to them before making any decision. Voters must analyse the tradeoffs between each combination of priorities, ideas and contributors. This greatly increases the decision complexity as a voter may want to endorse certain priorities or ideas but not the contributors who are attached to that proposal and vice versa where they fully support the contributors involved but not the ideas or priorities they are suggesting.



**Very low voter choice flexibility (Score - 1)**

If a voter wanted to select any specific priorities, ideas or contributors they would be unable to do so at the voting stage unless the exact combination of priorities, ideas and contributors was already submitted as a voting option. The voter can only choose between what the contributors submit as their own preferred combination.



**Very high future decision change complexity (Score - 1)**

To make future changes to previous decisions an entire new proposal would be needed to suggest any of the changed priorities, ideas or contributors in a similar proposal based on the exact change that was needed. Alternatively the ecosystem would need to introduce a separate change process to make changes to any specific areas. The obvious issue with this however is it then adds in even more processes and complexity to the disbursement process. If the processes were independent then voters would be able to reuse the same systems they used for the initial vote to make changes.



**Very high contributor participation complexity (Score - 1)**

Contributors would need to commit a large amount of time to get involved in contributing to the ecosystem as they would need to suggest priorities, ideas and how those ideas would be executed in a single proposal. Contributors would need to learn and be sufficiently effective at a wider range of skills if they wanted to suggest priorities, ideas and ways to execute those ideas all in one process. If these were separated processes a contributor would only need to be good at one of those processes to be able to more easily and effectively contribute towards the ecosystem. For instance if one community member had a deep understanding of one part of an ecosystem they may be very well suited to creating high impact priorities for the community to consider. That same community member might not have the ideas on how to address that priority nor the capacity or willingness to execute the ideas but their contributions for priority settings could be highly valuable.



**Total score = 6 / 25**
