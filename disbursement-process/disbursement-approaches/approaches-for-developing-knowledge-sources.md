# Approaches for developing knowledge sources

Knowledge plays a vital part in making well informed disbursement decisions. An amount of knowledge will be available to an ecosystems community at the point in which disbursement decisions are made. The more that useful knowledge is available and the more that it is accurate and relevant the easier it should become for voters to make more optimal disbursement decisions.



Creating or improving new knowledge sources can be an effective way to make disbursement decision making more well informed. An ecosystem will want to consider how it finds, creates and improves its knowledge sources to improve the voters decision making ability.



Knowledge could come from one off pieces of research and analysis but also could come in the form of automated systems that gathers and analyse different areas of information. A transaction explorer is a good example of an automated knowledge system that would provide information about a distributed ledgers transactions that have been processed. This type of system could be highly insightful for determining how a distributed ledger is actually being used.



Relevant knowledge could come from many different sources:

* **Treasury operation** - The operation of the treasury itself will produce data and insights in how the treasury and ecosystem is performing, such as how effective it’s own approaches are for increasing or maintaining income or whether the disbursement of assets is generating sufficiently impactful outcomes. The variety of different data points involved in operating the treasury could be highly useful for influencing future contribution efforts and identifying where certain improvements can be made to the operation of the treasury or the wider ecosystem.
* **Treasury disbursement** - An ecosystems treasury disbursement can help with funding initiatives that improve the available knowledge for a community to use to stay well informed when making future disbursement or governance decisions.
* **Competing ecosystems** - The same information that is relevant to one ecosystem can also be relevant to another ecosystem as it provides further knowledge about what is and isn’t working in different ecosystems. Analysis could help with identifying the reasons why some ecosystems are performing better in certain areas than others which can then lead to better decision making when determining how an ecosystem might be able to achieve a similar amount of success in that same area.
* **Many external areas** - Any other source of information outside an ecosystem that is relevant or useful as a source of new knowledge. Examples could be market and economic data, adoption, usage and sentiment trends for different products & services, demographic data and many others areas.



## Creating knowledge through treasury disbursement

As mentioned above the creation or improvement of knowledge could be achieved by funding different initiatives through the disbursement process. Those knowledge sources could help with improving the decision making ability of voters for future disbursement decisions.



The selection and funding of different pieces of knowledge could be achieved using the same idea and contributor selection process used for disbursement.



Let’s take an example knowledge initiative that could seek funding from treasury disbursement. For this example initiative there is a developer that wants to create an automated transaction usage explorer that shows what is happening inside each transaction and also at a higher level what is happening at a daily, weekly and monthly level so that a community can easily see how the ledger is actually being used and how that is changing over time. This knowledge source could be highly valuable for identifying where there might be inefficiencies or opportunities to improve or expand certain areas. This knowledge source could help lead to new priorities that then get addressed through the disbursement process in the future! Using this example we can now apply how that initiative might be funded with any of the disbursement approaches that have already been covered:

* **Fully combined process** - The developer would create a proposal stating there is an opportunity to create a transaction usage explorer that currently doesn’t exist. They would also then break down the idea and how they intend to make it along with who would be involved in executing the transaction explorer.
* **Idea & contributor combined process** - The developer would create a proposal that breaks down the idea and how it could be developed along with who would be involved in executing the idea. A priority is not required to exist or be selected for this idea to be suggested - an existing priority may or may not exist already.
* **Independent processes** - The developer would create an idea proposal suggesting a transaction explorer as an idea for the ecosystem consider. The developer would also create a contributor proposal that outlines that they can help with the software development involved in this idea or any of the selected ideas.
* **Passive idea selection process** - The same as independent processes however the idea selection would mostly be left to the contributors apart from situations where the wider community chooses to participate in idea selection.
* **Delegated idea selection process** - The same as independent processes however the developer would make the decision on exactly what ideas they will work on if they get selected as a contributor.



Funding knowledge initiatives could happen in the same disbursement process as other types of ideas or it could be handled differently than other types of idea. For instance one ecosystem might decide that new software applications will go through a idea & contributor combined process approach and that knowledge related initiatives will go through a delegated idea selection process. That would mean that contributors would be selected and compensated to identify and improve the existing knowledge sources in an ecosystem and would take responsibility for identifying the most impactful areas to work on.
