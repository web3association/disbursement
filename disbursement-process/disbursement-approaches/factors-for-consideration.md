# Factors for consideration

The following are some of the different factors worth considering when comparing some of the different disbursement approaches. An approximate score has been added against each approach with the rationale behind the score for each of the different factors. The scoring for each area will range from 1 (very bad) to 5 (excellent).



**Voter participation complexity**

* **Description** - Voter participation complexity focuses on determining how complex it is for a voter to participate in the disbursement processes.
* **Why it’s important** - The higher the complexity the higher the likelihood of increased voter apathy and disengagement from potential voters.
* **Scoring questions** - How much context and information is required for someone to be well informed in the process? How much time would need to be committed to participate? How long could it take to make a decision? Can the voter participate in only the decisions they’re interested in or must the be involved in every part of the process covering priorities, ideas and contributors?
* **Scoring** - Lower complexity is good (Score - 5). Higher complexity is bad (Score - 1).



**Voter decision complexity**

* **Description** - Understanding how complex it is for a voter to make designs around selecting priorities, ideas and contributors for the execution of ideas.
* **Why it’s important** - The more complex the decision process is the easier it becomes for voters to make suboptimal decisions or alternatively to simply disengage with the process and delegate the decision to someone else.
* **Scoring questions** - How complex is it for a voter to make an informed decision when they want to properly participate in one of the disbursement process votes? How fast can voters make an informed decision?
* **Scoring** - Lower complexity is good (Score - 5). Higher complexity is bad (Score - 1).



**Voter choice flexibility**

* **Description** - Looking at what flexibility the voter has to choose the exact priorities, ideas and contributors they believe are most promising and potentially impactful.
* **Why it’s important** - The more flexibility there is the more that voters are able to express their opinions and preferences more exactly for which priorities, ideas and contributors are the most impactful and promising for the ecosystem.
* **Scoring questions** - How much flexibility is there for the voter to precisely select the priorities, ideas and contributors they believe are most promising?
* **Scoring** - High flexibility is good (Score - 5). Low flexibility is bad (Score - 1).



**Future decision change complexity**

* **Description -** Thinking about what complexities would emerge for an ecosystem that wants to change the priorities, ideas and contributors involved in the future due to changing information or a changing environment.
* **Why it’s important** - The more complex it is for an ecosystem to make changes to the existing priorities, ideas and contributors involved the slower that the disbursement process can become in adapting to important changes in its environment. This slower ability to manoeuvre and change can then lead to stagnation and slower adaptability.
* **Scoring questions** - How easily can an ecosystem change their decisions in the future as new knowledge emerges which can influence which priorities, ideas and contributors are the most promising and suitable at that moment in time? How easily can contributors change their execution approach to react to a fast changing environment?
* **Scoring** - Lower complexity is good (Score - 5). Higher complexity is bad (Score - 1).



**Contributor participation complexity**

* **Description** - Understanding how complex it is for someone to make contributions to the disbursement process such as creating or helping with emerging priorities or ideas or helping with the execution of ideas.
* **Why it’s important** - The higher the complexity there is for people to contribute to an ecosystem the harder it will be for people to make potentially impactful contributions.
* **Scoring questions** - How easy is it for someone to suggest priorities, ideas or execution approaches? What amount of information and context is required for someone to contribute to any of the disbursement areas? What time commitment is needed to make these contributions?
* **Scoring** - Lower complexity is good (Score - 5). Higher complexity is bad (Score - 1).
