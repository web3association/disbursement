# Disbursement operating process

The [general purpose operating process](http://127.0.0.1:5000/s/qIN4B3DGHPqKOl7e6VuV/web-3-treasuries/operating-process) can be applied to how a treasury disburses assets to help with thinking about how this can be done most effectively to help with achieving ecosystem priorities.



## Knowledge



**Process steps**

* **Aggregating information** - Collating information is the first main part of trying to effectively disburse assets as the people involved in voting for how assets are disbursed need to be informed on what problems and opportunities exist, what has been tried already, what’s working and isn’t and many other factors to make their decisions more informed. If there is no knowledge systems in place then this process is done at an individual level where the people involved in the disbursement process will themselves do any research they want to help with improving their own judgement.
* **Selecting information** - Once a person has aggregated the information they believe is relevant, or if this information is made available in another adopted system, the next step for participants in the process would be to determine the important of each piece of information and its relevance to upcoming decisions. The voters would be responsible for determining what is correct information or not and which information is currently the most relevant.



**Why it’s important**

An ecosystem wants to make informed decisions on where funds should be disbursed so that assets are effectively allocated towards initiatives that help with achieving the priorities of an ecosystem. Some information that will be relevant for this process could include previous funded initiative performance and measured impact, on chain data, usage from the ecosystems own chain as well as on competing chains, security audits that identify any areas of concern or potential improvement, developer ecosystem information such as available libraries, SDKs and tools, adoption data looking at user sentiment and feedback, infrastructure performance metrics and industry technical advancement reports and insights. All of these example types of information can be beneficial for the community to know when making decisions and voting on where to best disburse funds to create the most impact.



**Information relevant to process**

Any information relevant to making well informed disbursement decisions could be included for consideration.

* **Current state of an ecosystem** - On-chain data covering usage and performance, historical funded initiative performance and impact generated, security audits covering ecosystem protocols and applications, current user sentiment and feedback, SDKs, tools and libraries available for software development, available products & services in the ecosystem with their current usage, adoption, problems and opportunities and performance and metrics for current execution approach.
* **External ecosystem information** - Competitor on-chain data covering usage and performance, other approaches used for technical infrastructure, protocol design or security audits, products and services launched in other ecosystems, latest industry technical advancements along with any reports and insights, industry overall sentiment and adoption data, economic data and current forecasts and regulatory changes.



**What happens in existing systems**

For many nation states or corporations there may or may not be any official form of knowledge systems or processes in place. For both nation states and corporations there will be a mixture of informational sources that help to influence any decisions about how treasury funds are disbursed.

* **Nation states** - Nation state treasuries could be interested in information such as foreign policies, economic data, inflation data, cost of living data, geopolitical information and national and international banking data amongst other areas.
* **Corporations** - Corporations could benefit from having information that covers market data, business metrics, competitors business performance, consumer trends, industry research and development progress and any economic data amongst other areas.



**Challenges for web 3 ecosystems**

* **Complexity in aggregating information** - Existing nation state and corporation treasury systems that have fewer people involved in decision making can more easily adopt a manual process for individually aggregating information they think is important before trying to make well informed decisions and optionally share this with others. If this knowledge needs to be distributed between a larger group of participants a manual approach becomes far most costly and difficult to scale. Web 3 ecosystems will need to find efficient and effective ways to aggregate relevant information about the ecosystem for participants in the disbursement process to review and understand. Considerations will be needed on how information can be most effectively presented to communicate the key points quickly and correctly to make this process of understanding what is happening in the ecosystem scalable. If the ecosystem is unable to get access to the right information when making disbursement decisions it will be more difficult to make well informed decisions. This factor is one reason why it is easier to centralise decision making in existing systems due to the need for those involved to be well informed on many different pieces of information to make more informed decisions.
* **Correctness of information** - As the scale and assets under management of web 3 ecosystems increase over time there is an increasing importance in making sure any information is correct when it will be used by participants voting on how funds are disbursed. If the information is biased or incorrect this could influence the outcomes of any disbursement decisions meaning this is an attack vector that will need to be constantly considered so these issues can be prevented.
* **Time cost of learning & knowledge sharing** - It takes time for people to read and understand information shared to them and then more time to apply that knowledge to treasury decisions about disbursement. The more information there is the more time it would take each person who wants to participate. This factors makes it difficult to scale decentralized governance so one of the challenges for web 3 ecosystems is being able to identify what information is most important for different decisions involved in a treasuries disbursement process and how can that information be most accurately and easily presented to participants using it to make voting decisions. Bringing the time cost down for sharing and understanding knowledge will make these emerging systems more easy to participate in and thus more scalable.



## Priorities



**Process steps**

* **Creating priorities** - Problems and opportunities can be identified through applying and analysing the information available in the ecosystem. A set of priorities can be created to better articulate those problems and opportunities that the voters should consider. Priorities could be created at a high level to help with communicating a preferred general direction an ecosystem wants to take. Priorities can also be lower level and more precise on what exact areas of the ecosystem could receive more attention and resources.
* **Priority** **selection decision** - Selecting priorities will have a big impact on the disbursement process as these preferences can heavily influence where funds get allocated. An ecosystem benefits from being able to communicate why certain preferences are important at the moment and then seeing the level of support those priorities receive over others from other community members of an ecosystem.



**Why it’s important**

Treasury funds could be disbursed to a wide range of different initiatives that each have their own opportunities and tradeoffs. Good prioritisation for an ecosystem can mean the difference between sustainability and growth over the long term over stagnation and decline. Ecosystem participants involved in disbursement process decisions will want to apply all of the relevant knowledge about the ecosystem to better define and determine which priorities are the most important at any given moment in time.



**Information relevant to process**

* **Ecosystem knowledge** - The priority setting process benefits from participants knowing as much of the information as possible that came out of the knowledge aggregation process. The more information that participants have about the ecosystem the more they are able to effectively analyse it and apply that information when thinking about what the current problems and opportunities are.
* **Current problems & opportunities** - The participants of the priority setting process will apply the knowledge available in the ecosystem to thoroughly understand what the biggest problems and opportunities are. This application of ecosystem knowledge will lead to thinking about many areas of the ecosystem to determine which areas may create the most impact if they were to receive more resources and attention:
  * Protocols & infrastructure - Are they any flaws in the current system design? How is it currently scaling against competition? Are more security audits needed? Should any recent advancements in cryptography or available software libraries be integrated?
  * Applications & services - What are the missing applications and services in the ecosystem that can be found elsewhere? What feature sets are missing in any of the existing applications? Can the amount of interoperability be increased to accommodate other ecosystems and help increase overall adoption?
  * Software libraries - Are there any missing software SDKs, frameworks, libraries or scripts that would make it easier for developers to create solutions? Is there anything that can be improved for existing libraries? Do any of these need better security guarantees? Should any of them be rewritten in other programming languages?
  * Ecosystem education - Do people understand how to participate and use all of the solutions and tools made available in the ecosystem? Are any of the applications, services, libraries or pieces of infrastructure too difficult to understand for their intended audience?



**What happens in existing systems**

In both nation state and corporation operating structures there could be open invites for more information, expertise and different perspectives from other employees in the organisation or even external consumers and citizens before priorities are set for that organisation.

* **Nation states** - Elected officials or employees helping to operate nation state treasuries would use any accumulated knowledge to suggest and select priorities to address based on the current problems or opportunities for the nation. If the nation states mandate is to help provide stability and growth for the nation using its economic policy then how treasury funds are used will likely mapped to the adoption of priorities that are derived from this mandate.
* **Corporations** - The leadership, management or board of directors of the corporation are the most likely to handle setting priorities and would be applying the knowledge they have to determine what problems and opportunities could most benefit the business over the short and long term.



**Challenges for web 3 ecosystems**

* **Increasing priority selection complexity** - As a web 3 ecosystem scales the complexity of selecting priorities could increase over time due to an increasingly diverse range of background, opinions and preferences in how the ecosystem should move forward. This increase in thought diversity will make priority selection more complex as there will be more priorities to choose from and also more participants that need to be well informed when voting on them.
* **Priority selection scope complexity** - Web 3 ecosystems will need to become effective enough at determining what level of scope the ecosystem can feasibly handle. The community will not want to set too few priorities that are too easy to achieve and result in stagnant and unused contributor capacity but on the other side they also don’t want to be overly ambitious and set too many priorities that would not be feasible or practical in any short to medium time frame.
* **Maintaining overall mission and purpose** - Growing web 3 ecosystems will mean increasing the diversity of opinion and preferences in how that ecosystem evolves over time. If the ecosystem was setup for a particular purpose initially this initial mission and purpose could fade over time and be lost as the ecosystem scales. Ecosystems will need to determine whether this is important to them or not and if so how they can maintain the pursuit of achieving that initial mission over the long term. A constitution can be one way in which the mission and values of an ecosystem can be recorded, the [United States constitution](https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution/constitution.htm) being one example.



## Ideas



**Process steps**

* **Creating ideas** - Creating ideas requires a good understanding of the opportunity or problem being addressed and a sufficient skill set and description of the steps or items required for an idea to be taken through to execution. Contributors who are creating ideas will need to consider the complexity of the idea, how long it might take to execute, what evidence there is that it will be impactful in addressing the current priorities, what other skills are needed for the idea to be executed correctly and what amount of capital will be required to fully execute and measure the outcomes of that idea.
* **Idea selection decision** - There are many ideas that could help with addressing ecosystem priorities. A lot of effort is needed to effectively articulate and document how one idea could be effective for addressing certain priorities. Community members participating in selecting the most promising ideas will then need to then compare these suggested ideas against the priorities they are addressing and determine which ones are the most promising at that moment in time for creating impact in the ecosystem.



**Why it’s important**

Once an ecosystem has a clear understanding of what information is important and what they want to prioritise the most important the next step will be generating ideas that would be suitable as potential solutions to address the selected priorities. Part of the idea generation process will be the application of knowledge the ecosystem has by considering what is happening in other ecosystems and markets to then create ideas which are both feasible and potentially highly impactful.



**Information relevant to process**

* **Current priorities** - When ideas are created they will need to articulate what problem or opportunity this idea would be addressing. Is this idea currently a priority set by the ecosystem or is it a completely new priority the author is suggesting? An understanding of the current priorities can also help with inspiring people to think about what ideas could help address them.
* **Ecosystem knowledge** - All of the knowledge available in the ecosystem could be useful when thinking about how ideas are created and selected. Some example areas for consideration would include whether that idea has been executed before inside or outside the ecosystem? If it has, was it executed fully, what impact did it make and what risks or opportunities exist for the execution of this idea?



**What happens in existing systems**

Ideas may be welcomed from any range of participant involved in either nation state or corporation treasury disbursement decisions. Ideas from those outside of the operation of these treasuries could come for feedback forms, interviews, polls and surveys. Employees involved in any organisation with a treasury to manage could also often play an important role in idea generation for how funds are disbursed within either of these environments. Employees would often be the most well informed on what is feasible and practical in terms of execution.

* **Nation states** - The range of ideas a nation state treasury can pursue might be limited due to the mandate for the treasury such as ensuring the stability and growth of the nation. As well as this there could also likely be existing national departments setup to handle different key infrastructure or public service areas. Ideas will look at exploring what the nations treasury could do better to achieve its priorities and overall mandate. This could include thinking about the impact of central bank interest rates moving forward, what total spending and borrowing amounts are suitable for that financial year and what budgets would be sensible for each of the national departments.
* **Corporations** - For corporations the diversity of ideas it may pursue could be vast as they might be interested in operating in multiple different markets and be willing to provide a range of service or product offerings. Employees within corporations could help with idea generation by assessing how any existing services or products could be improved or updated to address the priorities set by the corporation. In some cases a completely new product or service could be suggested. The teams and management involved in addressing any of these priorities will need to select which ideas appear to be most promising and then may need to communicate this for wider approval. Teams in corporate structures may also be given the full responsibility to lead both idea generation and selection of the most suitable ideas in some organisations.



**Challenges for web 3 ecosystems**

* **Idea selection complexity** - As the number of ideas increase with more potential solution paths for addressing priorities the complexity in choosing between those ideas increase. This makes governance more complex and less scalable. A disbursement process will benefit from trying to remove any duplication of ideas and finding ways to keep ideas concise for readability but in sufficient depth so informed decisions can be made.
* **Need for flexibility to change ideas** - New information and knowledge or changing priorities can quickly influence whether an idea continues to make sense or not in the current environment and also how that idea may need to be changed to adapt to these changes. The faster the pace is for the ecosystem to introduce new changes the more important it will be for existing ideas that are being considered for execution to be able to react to these changes and adapt, replace or remove their ideas as necessary.
* **Idea complexity** - Web 3 technology is inherently complex due to the intersection of cryptography, economics and distributed software when trying to make scalable and decentralized infrastructure. A disbursement process will need to handle this complexity of ideas which require sufficient room for explanation and review. Disbursement processes will need to think about how these ideas can be more easily communicated in a way that a sufficiently wide audience can interpret when they are trying to make their own decisions around where to disburse funds.



## Execution



**Process steps**

* **Contributor selection decision** - The process for an ecosystem looking to select contributors would start with considering the educational and professional background of those who would like to contribute along with any information around their recent contributions or involvement in the ecosystem with any other relevant experience. Voters would then need to compare these contributors against the priorities and ideas currently preferred by the ecosystem and determine which of these contributors would be a good fit for helping to address the priorities and execute promising ideas.
* **Improving execution process** - The selected contributors will need to reflect and improve how they approach the execution of ideas on an ongoing basis. This can include reflecting on what the current best practices are, how to best communicate and coordinate with each other, how low level priorities and goals are set and how to mitigate potential future issues amongst numerous other considerations. Contributors will need to strike a balance between focussing on getting work done with updating their operating approach and following best practices.
* **Measuring outcomes** - Understanding what impact an executed idea has produced is inherently complicated due to the range of ways an idea could be executed and the range of variables that influence whether a solution has actually achieved the impactful outcomes or not. An ecosystem will want to get better at being able to measure the impact of outcomes they generate so that this information can be fed back into the disbursement process to improve future decision making and any subsequent execution of ideas.



**Why it’s important**

Achieving ecosystems priorities and creating impact is possible when the right ideas get executed. An ecosystem will need to decide how and who will execute the most promising ideas and then after execution then measure the outcome to determine whether the priorities are being addressed. Many funding processes will also adopt some form a verification process to ensure that progress is being made by any funded contributors working on these ideas. The outcomes from the execution process will help with creating more data and insights that can be fed back into the ongoing disbursement process to help improve how future funds are allocated. The better that outcomes can be measured for impact the more that new knowledge can be discovered to better influence future decisions.



**Information relevant to process**

* **Current priorities** - Understanding the current priorities will help with thinking about what the range of skills and experience might be required to effectively help with addressing them.
* **Current ideas** - Suggesting or understanding the ideas that are currently preferred for addressing priorities will give a better indication of the exact skills and experience required to execute them. The more complex an idea is the more important it will be that the contributors involved in its execution have a relevant professional background and experience.
* **Ecosystem knowledge** - Understanding how different ecosystems are executing their own ideas and measuring their own outcomes will provide useful information for contributors to reflect on when improving their own processes. Changes in technology, security best practices or the available software and libraries are all example areas of new information that could benefit any contributors trying to execute ideas to a high standard.



**What happens in existing systems**

* **Nation states** - The execution for treasury disbursement for nation states can often mean distributing a certain budget to different national departments, this funding then in turn gets used to pay for employees and operational costs. The nation state treasury could influence or be responsible for new policies that change what treasury income is received through taxation and also influence how funds are disbursed. Once any of these changes are made there will be more data made available over time that help with determining how those changes are performing against the priorities for the treasury. Other areas around data, insights and citizen sentiment could also become available and provide more information about the current stability and growth of the economy due to the changes made.
* **Corporations** - For corporations, treasury assets are often disbursed to employees or contractors. With this disbursement structure already in place the teams responsible for executing selected ideas can do so as soon as any ideas are selected. Ideas that require new teams to form before they can be executed could be achieved through hiring efforts. In terms of measuring outcomes corporations will often be more focussed on the service or product performance metrics which give more indication on how an executed idea is performing financially and in terms of satisfaction with their customers.



**Challenges for web 3 ecosystems**

* **Need for flexibility to change execution** - New information and knowledge, priorities and ideas can emerge and change at anytime during the execution of an idea. In fast changing environments such as web 3 ecosystems the contributors who are executing ideas will need to be responsive to the changing environment and needs of the ecosystem to align themselves most effectively with creating impactful outcomes. Web 3 ecosystems will need to consider how they can be most efficient to allowing execution to respond to many factors so treasury funds are not wasted on low impact outcomes.
* **Measuring impact complexity** - When ideas are executed the actual impact generated by that initiative can be difficult to track due to the amount of factors involved. A range of data and information could be relevant for determining whether the priorities are being addressed and whether impact was actually generated.
