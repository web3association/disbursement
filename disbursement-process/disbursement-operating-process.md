# Disbursement Operating Process

The general purpose operating process can be applied more to a treasuries disbursement process to help with thinking about how funds can be effectively disbursed and help with achieving ecosystem priorities.



## Knowledge



**Why it’s important**

An ecosystem wants to make informed decisions on where funds should be disbursed so that assets are effectively allocated towards initiatives that help with achieving the priorities of an ecosystem. Some information that will be relevant for this process could include previous funded initiative performance and measured impact, on chain data, usage from the ecosystems own chain as well as on competing chains, security audits that identify any areas of concern or potential improvement, developer ecosystem information such as available libraries, SDKs and tools, adoption data looking at user sentiment and feedback, infrastructure performance metrics and industry technical advancement reports and insights. All of these example types of information can be beneficial for the community to know when making decisions and voting on where to best disburse funds to create the most impact.



**What happens in existing systems**

For many nation states or corporations there may or may not be any official form of knowledge systems or processes in place. For both nation states and corporations there will be a mixture of informational sources that help to influence any decisions about how treasury funds are disbursed.

* **Nation states** - Nation state treasuries could be interested in information such as foreign policies, economic data, inflation data, cost of living data, geopolitical information and national and international banking data amongst other areas.
* **Corporations** - Corporations could benefit from having information that covers market data, business metrics, competitors business performance, consumer trends, industry research and development progress and any economic data amongst other areas.



**Challenges for web 3 ecosystems**

* **Complexity in aggregating information** - Existing nation state and corporation treasury systems that have fewer people involved in decision making can more easily adopt a manual process for individually aggregating information they think is important before trying to make well informed decisions and optionally share this with others. If this knowledge needs to be distributed between a larger group of participants a manual approach becomes far most costly and difficult to scale. Web 3 ecosystems will need to find efficient and effective ways to aggregate relevant information about the ecosystem for participants in the disbursement process to review and understand. Considerations will be needed on how information can be most effectively presented to communicate the key points quickly and correctly to make this process of understanding what is happening in the ecosystem scalable. If the ecosystem is unable to get access to the right information when making disbursement decisions it will be more difficult to make well informed decisions. This factor is one reason why it is easier to centralise decision making in existing systems due to the need for those involved to be well informed on many different pieces of information to make more informed decisions.
* **Correctness of information** - As the scale and assets under management of web 3 ecosystems increase over time there is an increasing importance in making sure any information is correct when it will be used by participants voting on how funds are disbursed. If the information is biased or incorrect this could influence the outcomes of any disbursement decisions meaning this is an attack vector that will need to be constantly considered so these issues can be prevented.
* **Time cost of learning & knowledge sharing** - It takes time for people to read and understand information shared to them and then more time to apply that knowledge to treasury decisions about disbursement. The more information there is the more time it would take each person who wants to participate. This factors makes it difficult to scale decentralized governance so one of the challenges for web 3 ecosystems is being able to identify what information is most important for different decisions involved in a treasuries disbursement process and how can that information be most accurately and easily presented to participants using it to make voting decisions. Bringing the time cost down for sharing and understanding knowledge will make these emerging systems more easy to participate in and thus more scalable.



## Priorities



**Why it’s important**

Treasury funds could be disbursed to a wide range of different initiatives that each can have their own opportunities and tradeoffs. Good prioritisation for an ecosystem can mean the difference between sustainability and growth over the long term over stagnation and decline. Ecosystem participants involved in the disbursement process decisions will want to apply all of the relevant knowledge about the ecosystem to better define and determine which priorities are the most important at that given moment in time.



**What happens in existing systems**

In both nation state and corporation operating structures there could be open invites for more information, expertise and different perspectives from other employees in the organisation or even external consumers and citizens before priorities are set for that organisation.

* **Nation states** - Elected officials or employees helping to operate nation state treasuries would use any accumulated knowledge to suggest and select priorities to address based on the current problems or opportunities for the nation. If the nation states mandate is to help provide stability and growth for the nation using its economic policy then how treasury funds are used will likely mapped to the adoption of priorities that are derived from this mandate.
* **Corporations** - The leadership, management or board of directors of the corporation are the most likely to handle setting priorities and would be applying the knowledge they have to determine what problems and opportunities could most benefit the business over the short and long term.



**Challenges for web 3 ecosystems**

* **Increasing priority selection complexity** - As a web 3 ecosystem scales the complexity of selecting priorities could increase over time due to an increasingly diverse range of background, opinions and preferences in how the ecosystem should move forward. This increase in thought diversity will make priority selection more complex as there will be more priorities to choose from and also more participants that need to be well informed when voting on them.
* **Priority selection scope complexity** - Web 3 ecosystems will need to become effective enough at determining what level of scope the ecosystem can feasibly handle. The community will not want to set too few priorities that are too easy to achieve and result in stagnant and unused contributor capacity but on the other side they also don’t want to be overly ambitious and set too many priorities that would not be feasible or practical in any short to medium time frame.
* **Maintaining overall mission and purpose** - Growing web 3 ecosystems will mean increasing the diversity of opinion and preferences in how that ecosystem evolves over time. If the ecosystem was setup for a particular purpose initially this initial mission and purpose could fade over time and be lost as the ecosystem scales. Ecosystems will need to determine whether this is important to them or not and if so how they can maintain the pursuit of achieving that initial mission over the long term. A constitution can be one way in which the mission and values of an ecosystem can be recorded, the [United States constitution](https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution/constitution.htm) being one example.



## Ideas



**Why it’s important**

Once an ecosystem has a clear understanding of what information is important and what they want to prioritise the most important the next step will be generating ideas that would be suitable as potential solutions to address the selected priorities. Part of the idea generation process will be the application of knowledge the ecosystem has by considering what is happening in other ecosystems and markets to then create ideas which are both feasible and potentially highly impactful.



**What happens in existing systems**

Ideas may be welcomed from any range of participant involved in either nation state or corporation treasury disbursement decisions. Ideas from those outside of the operation of these treasuries could come for feedback forms, interviews, polls and surveys. Employees involved in any organisation with a treasury to manage could also often play an important role in idea generation for how funds are disbursed within either of these environments. Employees would often be the most well informed on what is feasible and practical in terms of execution.

* **Nation states** - The range of ideas a nation state treasury can pursue might be limited due to the mandate for the treasury such as ensuring the stability and growth of the nation. As well as this there could also likely be existing national departments setup to handle different key infrastructure or public service areas. Ideas will look at exploring what the nations treasury could do better to achieve its priorities and overall mandate. This could include thinking about the impact of central bank interest rates moving forward, what total spending and borrowing amounts are suitable for that financial year and what budgets would be sensible for each of the national departments.
* **Corporations** - For corporations the diversity of ideas it may pursue could be vast as they might be interested in operating in multiple different markets and be willing to provide a range of service or product offerings. Employees within corporations could help with idea generation by assessing how any existing services or products could be improved or updated to address the priorities set by the corporation. In some cases a completely new product or service could be suggested. The teams and management involved in addressing any of these priorities will need to select which ideas appear to be most promising and then may need to communicate this for wider approval. Teams in corporate structures may also be given the full responsibility to lead both idea generation and selection of the most suitable ideas in some organisations.



**Challenges for web 3 ecosystems**

* **Idea selection complexity** - As the number of ideas increase with more potential solution paths for addressing priorities the complexity in choosing between those ideas increase. This makes governance more complex and less scalable. A disbursement process will benefit from trying to remove any duplication of ideas and finding ways to keep ideas concise for readability but in sufficient depth so informed decisions can be made.
* **Need for flexibility to change ideas** - New information and knowledge or changing priorities can quickly influence whether an idea continues to make sense or not in the current environment and also how that idea may need to be changed to adapt to these changes. The faster the pace is for the ecosystem to introduce new changes the more important it will be for existing ideas that are being considered for execution to be able to react to these changes and adapt, replace or remove their ideas as necessary.
* **Idea complexity** - Web 3 technology is inherently complex due to the intersection of cryptography, economics and distributed software when trying to make scalable and decentralized infrastructure. A disbursement process will need to handle this complexity of ideas which require sufficient room for explanation and review. Disbursement processes will need to think about how these ideas can be more easily communicated in a way that a sufficiently wide audience can interpret when they are trying to make their own decisions around where to disburse funds.



## Execution



**Why it’s important**

Achieving ecosystems priorities and creating impact is possible when the right ideas get executed. An ecosystem will need to decide how and who will execute the most promising ideas and then after execution then measure the outcome to determine whether the priorities are being addressed. Many funding processes will also adopt some form a verification process to ensure that progress is being made by any funded contributors working on these ideas. The outcomes from the execution process will help with creating more data and insights that can be fed back into the ongoing disbursement process to help improve how future funds are allocated. The better that outcomes can be measured for impact the more that new knowledge can be discovered to better influence future decisions.



**What happens in existing systems**

For nation states, the execution for treasury disbursement can often mean distributing the amount of agreed funding to the relevant departments which then in turn gets used to pay for employees and any operational costs. For corporations, treasury disbursement itself is often already setup and employees are paid an annual salary meaning the teams responsible for executing selected ideas can do so as soon as they are selected. In terms of measuring the performance and outcome from any treasury disbursement nation states generally have more of a mandate to record and publicise exactly how funds are used as well as any relevant performance metrics. Corporations are often more focussed on service or product offering metrics that give more indication on how an executed idea is performing.

* **Nation states** - The nation state treasury could influence or be responsible for new policies that change what treasury income is received through taxation and where funds are disbursed to. Once any of these changes are made more data will become increasingly available over time around how those initiative are performing against the priorities the treasury has set. Other areas of data, insights and citizen sentiment could also become available as these changes are made that help provide more clarity around the current stability and growth of the economy due to any changes.
* **Corporations** - Selected ideas by the founding entities or community are funded and executed through the usage of treasury assets. Many funding processes adopt some form a verification process to ensure progress is being made on the different funded initiatives. The outcomes from these funded initiatives will help to better inform the community on where future funding should be directed in the future to make more impact. The better that outcomes can be measured for impact the more that new knowledge can be discovered to better influence future decisions. Better measured outcomes will help with improving how the treasury goes through the disbursement process and select the most impactful initiatives with any future fund disbursements.



**Challenges for web 3 ecosystems**

* **Need for flexibility to change execution** - New information and knowledge, priorities and ideas can emerge and change at anytime during the execution of an idea. In fast changing environments such as web 3 ecosystems the contributors who are executing ideas will need to be responsive to the changing environment and needs of the ecosystem to align themselves most effectively with creating impactful outcomes. Web 3 ecosystems will need to consider how they can be most efficient to allowing execution to respond to many factors so treasury funds are not wasted on low impact outcomes.
* **Measuring impact complexity** - When ideas are executed the actual impact generated by that initiative can be difficult to track due to the amount of factors involved. A range of data and information could be relevant for determining whether the priorities are being addressed and whether impact was actually generated.
