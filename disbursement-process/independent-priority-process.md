# Independent priority process

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/independent-priorities-process.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

An independent priority process means the creation and selection of the most important priorities an ecosystem wants to focus on happening separately from how ideas or contributors get suggested or selected.

When thinking about the intersection between priorities and execution, it is difficult to find any sufficient rationale as to why these two processes would ever be combined. Priorities lead to the generation of ideas to address those priorities and then contributors help to execute the most promising ideas. It is ideas that are the main connecting point between both priorities and execution.

Priorities and ideas are closely connected processes. Creating an impactful idea depends on having the right priorities in place. An idea can be created to help with addressing those priorities. There is a many to many relationship between priorities and ideas; a priority can have many ideas addressing that priority and an idea can address many priorities. This factor amongst numerous others leads to a wide range of advantages for keeping the prioritisation and idea setting processes separate from each other during treasury disbursement.]



**Advantages of an independent priority process**

* **Lower voter participation complexity** - A voter can participate in just the priority setting process and does not need to select the most promising ideas or contributors to execute those ideas. By keeping this process independent a wider range of community members can participate in the priority selection, voters who might have only been interested in participating and voting on which priorities are the most important.
* **More voter choice flexibility** - Not attaching priorities to ideas means the voter can fully focus on comparing all of the potential priorities being suggested. Now a voter doesn’t need to concern themselves with the strength of an idea at the priority selection stage and instead would have more flexibility to decide on the exact priorities they believe are important at that moment. Following this they can then select the exact ideas that are most promising in any combination with the priorities that they prefer. This separation of concerns gives the voter more flexibility to express their opinion more precisely regarding which priorities are most important.
* **Lower voter decision complexity** - Keeping priorities selection independent from idea selection means that voters do not have to compare a combination of factors all at once. In a single combined process the voter would need to compare the merits of a priority and an idea against other combinations at the same time. The voter may agree with the priority but disagree with the idea and vice versa. Keeping priorities and ideas separate means voters can focus on the merits of the priorities individually and only compare the information relevant to those priorities.
* **Lower future change complexity** - Keeping priorities in a separate process means it becomes easier to let those priorities change over time based on changing community opinion. If the processes are combined then any votes to update an existing priority and idea combination would need to be replicated for any ideas that have similar priorities. If these processes are separate then setting priorities can become an ongoing and flexible process. Ideas could simply reference the current priorities that the idea would help with addressing. This can help with increasing participation from community members as they would be able to respond to opportunities and problems immediately by being able to quickly suggest a new priority or provide feedback to an existing one and continue the discussion around that topic. Any currently selected ideas could also benefit from an independent priority process if that process helped generate more efficient priority changes. The authors and contributors involved in an idea could then react and respond to how any priorities are changing over time by making suggestions and amendments to any current ideas as necessary.
* **Lower contributor participation complexity** - Contributors would not need to suggest both the priorities and the ideas if the processes were independent. Now contributors could instead just suggest an idea and reference which existing priorities are relevant for that idea. This reduces the complexity for contributors as they can decide to just help with addressing existing priorities rather than participate in the priority setting process. Contributors who just want to suggest priorities would also now be able to so without needing to suggest the ideas that attempt to address that priority.
* **Increased ability to handle a fast changing environmen**t - Having a separate priority setting process makes it easier for an ecosystem to react to a fast changing environment. Some sudden priority changes could include when a solution is suddenly launches that address an existing priority, when an external factors changes the operational environment (quantum computing being a potential example) or when new information emerges that provides evidence that another area of focus could create more impact. In these events a community benefits from being able to quickly respond by voting on new priorities that address these problems or opportunities. These priorities wouldn’t need to have any ideas attached to them at this stage. Instead this separate process would help with allowing an ecosystem to start the discussion around any emerging problems or opportunities and these efforts can then lead to the generation of new ideas.
* **Encourages more reflection & discussion** - If priorities and ideas are combined it can become more difficult to separate out community discussion about the importance of the priority and the idea independently. If priorities are created and set in a separate process it becomes easier to have in depth discussion around the importance of a priority and any surrounding information that supports it. Selecting the most important priorities separately means that all community members will be able to see how the wider ecosystem has voted on different priorities and then reflect on that information. If people are able to see which priorities are most important to other community members ahead of selecting any ideas they will be able to then reflect on whether they agree or disagree with the general consensus. If they do agree then this reflection could help with improving subsequent disbursement decisions to address those priorities. If they don’t agree with the selected priorities they would be able to easily contribute more rationale and generate more discussion around the priority to share why they believe a priority is important or not or why one priority is less or more important than another.
* **Increase inspiration for new ideas** - An idea won’t always be available that can be suggested to address a new priority. By keeping priority setting separate the most important priorities can be selected independent to whether an idea already exists or not. This is beneficial for an ecosystem as it makes it clearer amongst all the community members which priorities are actually the most important. This knowledge gives the community members more clarity and inspiration to then spend time on thinking about ideas that could help with addressing the most important priorities.
* **Consolidation of community feedback & engagement** - An independent process could invite a wide range of different community feedback such as a sentiment based votes or in depth question and answer sections. If all this feedback and engagement was coupled to an idea there is a risk that a single priority has relevant discussion around the matter scattered across many areas. Consolidating this information under the single priority using an independent priority process would help make it easier for community members to gather all the information and discussion needed about a current priority in one place.
* **Increased healthy competition between priorities** - The easier it is for community members to suggest priorities for the ecosystem to consider the more likely it will be that healthy competition emerges around a range of different suggested priorities. Not mixing priorities with other information such as idea helps to ensure that the focus and competition between priorities is fully focussed on the merits of each priority being suggested.
* **Increased integration opportunities** - Having an independent priority process means the ecosystem could look to integrate that same system across other systems and disbursement processes being used in the ecosystem. The same priority setting process could be integrated into multiple other disbursement processes that are trying to achieve different things for the ecosystem.



**Drawbacks of an independent priority process**

* **Sudden priority change complexity** - An independent priority process can allow for priorities to quickly and dynamically change based on the what the community currently thinks is the highest priority. This flexibility is useful for responding to sudden requirement changes however also means that the other processes involved in disbursement must be built to handle this faster paced environment. Sudden changes in prioritisation or elsewhere in the disbursement process could make it more difficult for voters to understand what is happening. Priorities will influence the contribution efforts being made by an ecosystem. An independent priority setting process has an attack vector where people may try to game the priority process at the selection stage to influence the rest of the disbursement process. This potential issue will need to be considered in the design of any independent priority setting system.
